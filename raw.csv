Where is Hank?|failed|AFEW THINGS ABOUT MEAtage thirteen I made my first movie, a short cartoon. And I got a kickout of it! At age nineteen I wrote my first feature script. Andshoved it into the drawer. At age twenty one I wrote twelve shortscripts, and shoved them into the drawer.  At age thirty one I wrotea script and found the agent. He shoved it into the drawer. At ageforty three I wrote the script and sent it to Hollywood. You guessedit, they shoved it into the drawer. Well, that really ticked me off.So, I wrote another script and made a movie. Finally!Favoritecolor: transparentFavoritefood: foodPoliticalorientation: hardened optimistOK,so much for formalities, now back to the movie.Where is Hank?The StoryOfficer Jack pulls into abandoned property. He walks straight towards the dead body concealed by the dense vegetation. Not noticing it, he turns back and leaves.Karen is uneasy. She's been looking for her landlord Hank, and instead she had found her ex-boyfriend from Chicago, whom she broke up with two years ago. Weird enough, they bumped into each other at the abandoned property. Two teenagers, Aaron and Kyle are also fond of the place. Torn up and abandoned, it's the perfect sanctuary, a spiritual hangout that will shake them to the bone. But for now their thrill is only to get stoned. Something is not right there. A lot of people would stop by, but not for long. Suddenly they would get restless and leave. There is something forbidding and eerie about it. The rumor has it, it's the place where Hank's twin brother Earl has lost his marbles.HOWTHIS MOVIE CAME TO BEFebruaryof 2007 I moved to Tucson. Both studios I worked for went bankruptwithin a month. Guess it was a sign. I picked a rental on the edge oftown. Film making was now only a distant past. In Chicago I worked onIndy projects, knew people and could call in favors. And in Tucson?Oh well, you win some and then lose even more. Or so I thought.THESETAsluck would have it, I lived right by the abandoned property. It was atrashed out shack with a lot of stuff baking in the sun. And itlooked weird. Like people had just left, leaving everything behind -some ten years ago. Then it dawned on me. It's a perfect setup for astory! A murder mystery! Adead body found at the abandoned property! It's an exterior - therewas no need for lighting or extra grips! Beautiful!Ifinished the story in a week and the script a month later.  Needless tosay, it had to be a comedy. Great! I can make the movie now!CASTAND CREWWell,not so fast Bubba! I was new to Tucson. How am I gonna find the goodtalent and the crew? At this point, I have to share a peculiar thingwith you. Every time I hit a wall with a project, and in desperation,utter words like “How on Earth am I gonna do that?”, things wouldjust happen. No joke, every time.So,a few days later, I unloaded my grief to Kevin (Patrick), the guy Iknew from the water store. “You know, I had been in a couple of lowbudget productions here in Tucson” he said. So we started talking.And I learned not only did he work in front of the camera but alsoknew the nuts and bolts of a rolling production. It was a Godsend!Inone stroke, I got the co-producer, casting director and the policeofficer character. Kevin did one casting call and all the characterscoasted in.Iplanned to use my old SD cam, but now, it just won’t cut it. Thetalent was too good to be wasted by a low quality image. So my piggybank succumbed to the unfortunate encounter with the hammer, and therest I borrowed (thanks Julius) and bought a new HD camera and a fewother things to make the shoot easier.Appropriately,the production company was named Flat Broke Pictures.THECAN THING...$30Kand twenty seven days later, the movie was in the can. I have tothank the crew and the cast - they were exceptional. There is asilver lining in this project. Every time we would finish a scene ortwo, the results were way beyond expectation. Casein point #1; I was hoping for an average cast and ended up withactors better than seasoned talent. Every one of them. Casein point #2; we were praying for a decent audio (the Achilles heal ofcountless indie movies) and even the pros commented on how clean theaudio was (thanks Kenny). Casein point #3; after reviewing the footage in open color IO (created bySony for big budget films) I found that it also has a pristine 35mmquality, with huge latitude and is ideal for compositing and keying.And that's a must..… ANDAFTER THE CANWell,I started tinkering with post-production during the shoot, butresults were frustrating. Editing, I am at home with, but propercolor correction? On 2K footage? Creating good particle CG? And don'teven get me started on sound design and the score... I tried variouslow end solutions, spent another $7K on equipment and after a year,finally realized that it will not suffice. High end post-productionis a very expensive, tedious and time consuming job when done right.LIGHTAT THE END OF THE TUNNELIna nutshell, it was depressing.Andthen one day, after uttering that quintessential line, “ And how onEarth am I suppose to do that?” I got a phone call from Tina(Gabrielle character). So, like any nice guy, I unloaded my griefonto her and she said “Why don't you try Kickstarter?”Kickstarter? What is that? I had no idea. I heard about it on NPRbut, I had no clue to what it was. And then I learned about crowdsourcing and realized it was the best chance I have to finish themovie the way I want it. Go straight to the audience and tell them -”Hey, this is the movie I want to make but I'm stuck! I need help!If you like the idea please pitch in”.So,there you have it. It took a while but, I had to break it down. Ineed your help. I would like to make this movie as good as possible. Foryears I worked on other productions, honing my craft, but I couldnever call them my own.  This movie has evolved in both quality andscope, way beyond my initial expectations. The way I see it, it hasthe potential to be a very good and entertaining motion picture.ABOUTFUNDING AND ALL THAT PHASE TALKSofar the project has cost a bit over $40K. It needs $95,000.00 to becompleted, $45,000.00 for PHASE I and $50,000.00 for PHASE II.PHASEI will pay for acquisition of additional footage of the airplaneinterior (green screen), additional B-roll (approximately anotherthirty hours), picture lock and sound design with the score.Ifthe goal is exceeded, the extra funds will be used for PHASE II,which includes creation of CG elements – airplane models (three –one small for wide shots, medium and a highly detailed one forextreme closeups (the original script had only noise and the shadowof the plane in it). Those CG shots will add a tremendous productionvalue to the movie), animation (cloud particles and rain sequence), compositing and color correction.Alot of shots need rotoscoping to fix up reflections and the depth offield (bad lens issue). This phase will also tackle title sequenceand animated transitions.Letme say a few words about the release schedule. The planned release isFall of 2014. Does it really take that long, you might ask?Unfortunately, it does. Let me explain.Thereare 65 scenes in the script, some long, some short. The airplane willadd 5 more. Footage wise, each scene was shot from a minimum of threedifferent angles with four takes per shot in average. We wereshooting two hours of footage per day, give or take. Multiply thatwith twenty seven days and you get fifty four hours of footage. Thatis without the B-roll, which is another twenty plus hours.Inaverage it takes four days to rough cut the scene. If you multiply thatwith sixty five scenes you end up with roughly nine months of editingonly, without the B-roll and the plane shots.EARLY COMPOSITING TESTSOnthe visual side, once editing is done there is another beast totackle. Compositing. Ifyou didn't, please check out COMPOSITING TESTS video clip. You willnotice that each take is repeated twice. First time in the originalform, and the second time with compositing effect.Sincewe couldn't drive the squad, we had to cheat. The car was parked andOfficer Jack was pretending he's driving.  To fix that, every bit ofscenery visible through the windows needs to be replaced with themoving background. And that's the easy part. Now, did you noticeanything odd with Police Officer's glasses? No? Check it out againand you'll see. Reflections in his glasses are that of a driveway,not a moving street. All that needs to be cleaned up and replaced aswell.Thereare plenty of shots needing similar treatment as well. You know howthe movie business works; if there is no budget for it, you cheat andthen fix it in the post - if you can.Well,you got a taste of what lies ahead on the visual side (not includingthe CG elements). I won't go into the score and sound design. That'sanother beast in it's own right. In short, it takes a lot of work tomake the movie look and feel rightB_Roll Sampler - footage is not color corrected or cleaned (city lights, cars and people have to be removed). This is just to give you a feel for some of the visuals in the movieForthree years I was trying to do it by putting every penny and sparetime into it, but it was a constant catching up game. I would get atop of the line computer and guess what? It's not fast enough and Ihad to upgrade. I would add plenty of storage space and realize it'snot nearly enough, because now the pipeline is changed to accommodateuncompressed edit, or compositing will not work out. So I had to addten more drives. And those issues are just the tip of the iceberg.Wehope “Where is Hank?” has sparked your curiosity and, like us,will want to see it finished. Please help us reach our goal andmake us proud with this project. Good movies can touch the heart, andwe hope “Where is Hank?” has touched yours.IFI PLEDGE, WHAT WILL I GET?Hugsand Kisses! Well, not really. As the next best thing you will receiveone or more movie memorabilia, DVD and the Blu Ray (depending on your pledge amount) andyour name will be immortalized for posterity in the movie credits(again, depending on your pledge amount). Not so shabby, huh? You canfind the details in the pledge amount section. Hereis the sampler of some of our unique memorabilia. Enjoy!And for the end, this is my old reel. It's far from perfect, but I was young then.

Squatch Watchers|failed|"SQUATCH WATCHERS TEASER #3What is Squatch Watchers?Squatch Watchers is a web series about a team of Bigfoot believers that are searching for the mysterious and elusive beast. So, wait? Is this fictional?No! The Squatch Watchers are comprised of real people and the series will document our search for Bigfoot. The first season will comprise of five episodes with a running time of around ten minutes each. Each episode begins with the team arriving in a new area of California and extensively searching it for any sign of Sasquatch. Local residents will be interviewed; scientists will be consulted to ensure the validity of this search. No rock will be left undisturbed until we declare an area is free of any Bigfoot.Why are you looking for Bigfoot? Aren’t there TV Shows that do that?We’re all big believers in Bigfoot. Sadly, television is doing a poor job of actually performing a real search. Most “monster” shows will show up in an area, and then leave that area without finding anything or even making any determination at all! WE WILL NEVER DO THAT. We’re not a television show that wants to keep the mystery going. We want to solve it. Now, this doesn’t mean that the show will be boring. No sir! We are internet comedians after all. Each episode will be the perfect 50/50 mixture of comedy and actual Bigfoot hunting. Who the heck are you guys?We already told you. We’re the Squatch Watchers!Be more specific!The Squatch Watchers are made up of Gene Shaw, Jerry Ahern, Jason Inman and Jen Trani. Jason and Gene will be co-directing the series. Each has years of experience in film, internet and commercial production.  Jason currently produces, shoots and edits for Youtube comedy duo, Rhett & Link. He also creates videos on his own YouTube channel (Jawiin) which has over 2.5 million views collectively. Gene is no slouch either. He has over a decade of experience in graphic design and illustration. His other credits include several AAA video games, best selling iPhone/iPad and Android apps and feature film editing and visual effects.Jason and Gene are also no strangers to shooting in the woods. Check out The Walking Dead Christmas Special, a video they co-created that won Best Parody Video at the 2013 Geeky Awards.Jason and Gene will also be helped out by the following:Scott Lobdell - A world famous comic book writer who has written acclaimed runs on Superman, X-Men, and Teen Titans. He has fallen in love with Bigfoot ever since writing about the creature in the pages of Alpha Flight.Chuck Testa - The internet's most famous taxidermist and Bigfoot believer. Chuck was named by Time Magazine one of 2011's top internet memes. Most well known for telling people, ""NOPE!""Jen Trani - Brilliant musician and internet famous guitarist who has released multiple albums and played in such bands as Jen & Abby and Malin Akerman and the Mystikats. She wants to use music to aid in the search for Bigfoot. Jerry Ahern - A comic book and Sasquatch lover who brings an enthusiastic and energetic drive to the search. Also the former host of the Cape Town Community Podcast.Why do you need me?The search for Bigfoot is actually a lot more difficult than it sounds. It’s not as simple as hopping in your car and beating on some trees, as some shows would have you believe. In fact, a large portion of the budget is strictly for traveling expenses. We want to make sure that we can get to the areas that have the most reported sightings of our big hairy friend. For the first season, the search will be limited to the state of California. But for Season 2, we want to expand to some of the northern states like Oregon and Washington.Wait, you’re already talking about Season 2?Of course! Our quest to find the Squatch only ends when we find him. First, we document California squatches, then we broaden the search to find out where else this elusive beast is camping out. We’ve put together the numbers and the budget we need is exactly the amount we are asking for. No more, no less. There are no line items for trips to Hawaii in this budget. That’s Season 4. So humbly and on bended knee, we turn to you to help us fund our search for Bigfoot.So what do I get for contributing?Limited time reward!

Zen in America: a film on Zen Buddhism in North America|successful|"* STRETCH GOAL ADDED: We've reached the minimum goal of $10,000, so the project is funded! However, as I discuss in the video and on this page, the estimated cost of the film in the end will be between $20,000 and $30,000. Any closer we can get to that goal will be of great help.ZEN IN AMERICA: A documentary film about Zen Buddhism in North America is the first documentary series of its kind to thoroughly examine the history and practices of Zen in North America. The series will take us to Zen temples throughout North America to show how Zen Buddhism is being expressed in our modern culture – gathering intimate accounts and insights from the teachers, practitioners and scholars of the tradition today. I began filming for the series in July of 2013. Over the next several years of my life, I will visit the many practice centers here in North America to document this diverse Buddhist tradition on film. It is my hope that you will be inspired to contribute to the documentary, help get the word out, and take some time to learn about the project today. Connect with us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Subscribe to our YouTube channel Visit the Zen in America websiteWatch the trailer for the filmWHAT THIS FILM SERIES WILL EXPLOREFrom the mid-19th century on more Americans have been reading about the teachings of Zen, finding wisdom and insight in what it has to teach us and inspiring many to take up its practice. What started out as a tradition we had inherited from early Japanese, Korean, Chinese and Vietnamese founders is today being carried forward by an ever growing number of Americans. From the more traditional practices to the more radically liberal in approach, Zen Buddhism is being simultaneously maintained and reshaped in the American grain.From the World Parliament of Religions to modern day, this important series will ask and endeavor to answer: How did Zen first arrive here? Who were its original pioneers? What are the various schools and lineages we see in North America today? What are the practices and ceremonies of Zen? How has the Zen landscape changed since those early years? What does a term like American Zen even mean? Does it exist and, if it does, what are some of its defining characteristics? What is the face of Zen Buddhism in North America today? What has been learned so far from this great experiment, from our many successes and failures?Above all else, this documentary series will strive to answer the most pressing question of all – ""What does this ancient, East Asian inheritance have to contribute to our modern American society?""THE STORY BEHIND THE FILM""Zen in America"" tells the story of Zen Buddhism in North America through a patchwork of interviews with teachers of all North American Zen lines, recollections and experiences of practitioners, analysis by scholars and academics, archival footage and photographs, and footage shot on location. Over the coming years, director Adam Kō Shin Tebbe will travel throughout North America to talk to the leaders and practitioners of the tradition. Having only begun shooting for the film in July of 2013, the film already includes interviews with the following American Zen teachers:Sojun Mel Weitsman, Hozan Alan Senauke, James Myoun Ford, Myoan Grace Schireson, Myo Denis Lahey, Jay Rinsen Weik, Karen Do'on Weik, as well as many North American practitioners.WHAT IS NEEDED TO SUCCEEDMaking this documentary series will take me on an amazing journey for the next number of years. I need your help and support today to help me get out on the road to continue filming. Logistically, I have everything I need to make this film: camera gear, lighting, laptops and storage for the film. What I need your help with today is getting (and keeping me) out on the road for the coming years of my life to continue collecting footage and interviews with some of America's leading voices on the Zen tradition. I will use rental cars and grab flights to do most of the legwork, and will stay in the homes of others, sleep in my car, or stay over at Zen temples when at a new location. Except in the case of some kind of an emergency, I do not plan to use hotels or motels for lodging (though I may camp).I have set a minimum goal of $10,000,which will get me out there and on the road filming. This story cannot be told without overwhelming support from backers. Realistically, this film will require $20,000 to $30,000 in the end to get to the many practice locations scattered throughout North America. How to help: By supporting our Kickstarter campaign for ZEN IN AMERICA, you can help us meet our outlined goals!Funds will be used for:Rental carsFlightsGasFood Emergency lodgingMiscellaneous equipmentREWARDSMAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO THE FILM AND RECEIVE REWARDSChoose what amount you want to give and what reward you would like to receive.

Deliberately austere, my compositions focus one’s attention to the detailed renderings of natural and man-made items that play out their balancing act on the painted stage. Wabi-sabi is a belief that all things living are imperfect, impermanent and incomplete. Things that are humble and modest are therefore beautiful in a small and quiet way. I try to capture this simple and understated beauty in nature.""Learn more about Stroman's work: http://www.bradstroman.com/1 HOUR PLANE RIDE AROUND SEATTLE$300 level: Licensed pilot and Rinzai Zen priest Genjo Marinello of Seattle’s Chobo-ji, who will be featured in the documentary series, is offering a one-hour plane ride around Seattle to two individuals on a date you and he determine.

WE ARE ONE: STREET MUSIC OF NEW ORLEANS|failed|“We Are One: Street Music of New Orleans”    “We Are One: Street Music of New Orleans,” is a spectacle of harmonious images and rhythm that encompasses the most unique city in America, New Orleans, Louisiana. In this city there is a pulse that beats with the bottom of a bass drum. The people of New Orleans walk, talk, breathe, and live by a rhythm unmatched and it doesn’t have to be justified. It just is. Social conditions become submissive to the quality of life in this city. Out of despair, poverty, corruption, etc. the emergence of the holy trinity of street music makes its mark.     Take a 90 minute journey through the streets of New Orleans as the soundtrack is set by native Brass, Rap, and Bounce in a way that only “The Big Easy” can do it. The accents speak the language, the food satisfies the palette, but the music fills in whatever else is lacking. You will never find a more culturally diverse city as New Orleans. The purpose of this film highlights that diversity and aims to lift the consciousness of the unaware. The rich spiritual history of the music comes through in many ways and the spotlight shines brightly on New Orleans. Starring in this film are legendary names such as: Partners n Crime, Cheeky Blakk, Ice Mike, Black Menace, Bust Down, Mr. Serv On, with special appearances by Youngfellaz Brass Band and The Original Pinettes Brass Band.      This project is completed through the principal photography phase and is currently in post-production. What I am seeking funding for is to assist in the costs of post-production and marketing and promotions. 
Star and the Snowman|successful|"A hitman known only as The Snowman.  A call girl known only as Star.  Not their real names, obviously, but real names are a liability in the shadowy underworld these characters inhabit.   Star and the Snowman is the story of two people searching for ""normal"" in a world of death, betrayal, and revenge.  Snowman is a killer born into a family of violence; he knows no other way of life.  Star is a woman out of control in a whirlwind of drugs and sex, unable to focus a damaged mind long enough to find an exit.  When Snowman's latest job threatens to rip open some very old wounds for them both, they find themselves torn between the opportunity to escape this hellish life, and the need to finally learn the truth about a decades-old secret which began the whole nightmare.  But in their world, learning the truth always comes with a heavy price, and such debts can only be paid in blood...    On the surface, Star and the Snowman is a crime drama, but like the characters themselves, the film is determined to tear beneath that surface.  It's a tale not only of guns and gangsters, but also of the depths to which the human soul can fall, and of the courage and strength needed to climb into the light again.  The filmmakers' intent is to transcend the conventions of genre, creating a universally potent drama whose bedrock will be the authenticity of its lead characters: two people struggling against a cruel world, armed only with the same hopes and dreams all of us share. We are Ohio-based filmmakers on a mission - a mission to produce world-class independent films in Ohio that can compete in the broader feature film market. Not an easy task.In the spring of 2012, we shot three scenes from the script as a proof-of-concept to illustrate director John Whitney’s vision for Star and the Snowman.These sample scenes were produced with the help of a professional volunteer crew dedicated to the film's success. That's the key. The most critical element of our plan is to surround ourselves with seasoned professionals that love the process of filmmaking and believe in us and our vision of making quality films.The one thing that weare sure of is that as filmmakers, we enjoy compelling stories aboutpeople who have been placed at a crossroads. In our past work, themesof loss and how people navigate life changes are what have driven uscreatively.  Fictional stories with one foot in reality that immerseaudiences in familiar worlds while asking questions, giving fewanswers and having the filmgoer ask themselves, “Whatwould I do?”  Wefeel this is essential to telling original and compelling stories. 	Becauseof the type of worlds in which our stories are set, we're able to useexisting locations to communicate the visual tone of our films. Bydoing this, our brand of filmmaking remains cost-effective andefficient without compromising quality or production value. Ourapproach follows in the footsteps of successful independent filmslike Sundance Grand Prize winning Winter’sBone and JeffNichols’ TakeShelter, which was shot and produced here in Ohio.These films were done with modest budgets. Bybringing together a talented team and working from a great script,they tell human stories that truly connect with the audience in a waythat has resulted in critical and commercial success. This mirrorsour philosophy.Because you want to see good movies made. Because you want to see THIS movie made. Because you're a good person. Because when this movie is completed, you can say, ""Oh, yeah. I helped make that happen."" And because you're a good person. I know...we said that twice but it's true. Lets make this happen.What if I can’t pledge right now?  No problem! You can still help us by sharing this page with your friends, family, and colleagues and spreading the word about our film and campaign.  Tweet us, share us, like us on Facebook—every bit helps.Every dime of what we raise through Kickstarter will go toward the three parts that make up phase one of producing Star and the Snowman.Part One -  Winter Scenes and 2nd Unit ExteriorsThe stark, gray Ohio winter itself is like a character in Star and the Snowman, and is essential to the tone and setting of the film. The winter weather is something we can't recreate - we have to capture the film's establishing shots, exteriors and footage for the title sequence in Steubenville and Mingo Junction, Ohio before we move into spring.  At the same time, additional shooting of winter urban landscapes will take place in Columbus and Cleveland as well.  This is an important element in the film. The mood we establish in the opening of the film and the atmosphere we infuse throughout the film is PARAMOUNT... so we feel that if we snooze, we lose on this. Part Two - CastingCasting an independent film is a delicate process and critical to the film’s success. If we don't handle it properly, we will have failed as filmmakers. While the majority of the roles in the film will be cast with regional actors, we think it's important to cast familiar faces in key supporting roles to better position ourselves when we offer the film to distributors.  To do this, we will be working with a Los Angeles-based casting director.Part Three – ProductionWe need funding for continued preproduction and materials for phase two of production, principal photography and additional fundraising.  We all know that Kickstarter is a powerful crowd-funding tool, but we can't rely on it alone to make the film happen. Kickstarter will also help us reach out to well-heeled individuals to help with our future funding goals. We also need to produce additional materials that will help us with further development, sales and marketing of the film.  If you want to build a house, you must have the proper tools.  Exciting and eye-catching materials that speak to the potential investor and outline our plan are paramount to the film's success.We have been working in production for over 20 years and have done everything from PA work to producing feature films.  And the takeaway from all of this experience is that we have the knowledge of what works and what doesn’t work in independent filmmaking.  We're in the process of building a strong creative team and crew made up of talented individuals who are dedicated to creating work of surpassing quality…and this is the start.John Whitney – the directorOur director is award-winning filmmaker John Whitney.  John’s films have played in festivals across the country and garnered a number of awards. His films A Passion for Filmmaking and The Fixer have screened on the Independent Film Channel (IFC). Check out his latest film Eroded which has garnered many awards.Bill Farmer – the writerThe script was written by two-time Nicholl Fellowship finalist William Farmer.  Bill is a seasoned Hollywood screenwriter who has optioned multiple scripts and most recently received story credit on the big budget film, Jonah Hex starring Josh Brolin.  We are extremely lucky to have Bill on board and feel that the script is fantastic.Kevin McClatchy – the leadKevin has been cast in the lead role in the film.  He is a member of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG), and has appeared in feature films and television programs including Unstoppable, Love and Other Drugs, NCIS, The X-Files, and General Hospital.  Kevin is also an accomplished stage actor and recently appeared in the CATCO production of Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo.Phil Garrett – producerPhil has 20 feature films under his belt in positions ranging from his earlydays as a production assistant to writing and producing. Phil'sexperience includes studio features and independent films in liveaction, animation, and visual effects, and his body of work includesprojects at DreamWorksAnimation SKG,PDI, and Disney.Dino Tripodis – producer & playing the role of “Frank” in the filmDino started Never the Luck Productions five years ago and produced the festival award-winning feature film Minus One, the short films The Funnyman and Happy Endings. Dino also served as co-producer on John Whitney's and Phil Garrett's award-winning short film Eroded.  He currently serves as Executive Producer of Nite Owl Theatre, an online series now in its second season.Gil Whitney – the cinematographerGil brings his talents and unique visual style to this film. He has worked on many independent short films and features and recently the documentary feature Meet the Phantods. Gil is also known for his award-winning cinematography on the short films Measured Sacrifice and The Fixer, which was broadcast on the Independent Film Channel.Michelle Messenger Garrett – publicist/PR coordinatorMichelle is a public relations consultant and award-winning writer with more than 20 years of experience executing successful PR strategies for companies ranging in size from small and startup businesses to enterprises such as Adobe and HP.

I'LL SEE YOU IN MY DREAMS - narrative feature film|successful|"STORYI'LL SEE YOU IN MY DREAMS tells the story of Carol (Blythe Danner), a widow in her 70s, who is struggling to find purpose and make sense of her increasingly isolated life in the ""twilight"" years. After the death of her dog rattles her routine, she decides to start dating again, and falls into relationships with two very different men -- the senior, exuberant Bill, who embraces life in the moment, and her younger pool cleaner, Lloyd (Martin Starr), who is struggling to find his purpose, much like Carol. Through these new relationships, Carol confronts her fears about love, family, aging, and death and is forced to adopt a new outlook as she comes to terms with this new phase of her life.I'LL SEE YOU IN MY DREAMS is a deceptively small story, but it asks big questions. The setting, characters, and honest, human approach make this a surprising and unique film. This is not an ""old person"" movie.

It won the Audience Award for Best Narrative Feature at the Sarasota Film Festival and was a Critic’s Pick in The Village Voice and LA Weekly. The film is 100% 'fresh' on www.RottenTomatoes.com. The New York Times said of the film, ""Out of raw materials, convincing 20-something dialogue, deft montages of night life, bowling, parties, the beachside setting - the director-screenwriter Brett Haley has built an encouraging feature film debut."" It was theatrically released in NY, LA and Florida before finding digital distribution.REBECCA GREEN (Producer)Rebecca Green is currently in post-production on the feature film IT FOLLOWS, written and directed by David Robert Mitchell, whose debut feature, THE MYTH OF THE AMERICAN SLEEPOVER, premiered at SXSW and went on to screen at the Cannes Film Festival.

UNDERWATER|successful|UNDERWATER is a half-hour comedic TV pilot about a couple in LA whoare so underwater on their mortgage that they can’t afford to break up… It’s alighthearted look at a situation more and more people are finding themselvesin—and one that ripples outwards to affect the couple’s friends and family insurprising ways.Co-written by Nathan Marshall and Michael Traynor, we arenow turning to the Kickstarter community with the goal of raising funds tofinish the project. We’ve written it. We’ve shot it. We’ve edited it.  And now we need your help to get ourshow through the final post-production steps so we can start sharing it withthe world!Wait—you already shot it?Yup! After years of paying dues and working on otherpeople’s projects, we wondered what would happen if we took matters into ourown hands. So we did! We looked around for inspiration, saw an America in recovery andconnected with all those folks who weren’t winning—and weren’t losing either—but were instead putting up a fight andmerely trying to keep their headsabove water. A couple underwater on their home and trapped in a fading marriageseemed like a great (and hilarious!)place to start—and the theme of “trying” became our meme.When the script was done, we were determined to make thisbaby happen—and started by calling everyone we knew to see if anyone could helppass the script on to a few excellent TV stars. Incredibly, the scriptresonated with folks and we were able to attach our dream cast, includingRachel Nichols (Criminal Minds, GI Joe), Brooke Nevin (BreakoutKings, The 4400) and Barry Bostwick (SpinCity, Cougartown). Our other excellent castmembers included Jude Angelini, Jacory Gums, Maura Murphy and Chris Wylde.Pawning vital organs(including some of our own) to cobble together production funding, we finallyshot the show over seven whirlwind days with an awesome crew filled to the brimwith passion, skill and energy drinks. Then—over the last three months, we’ve whittled the footage down into a tight, fast-moving, super-funny pilot that we can’t wait tostart showing people…And that’s where you come in!We shot Underwater for next to nothing with every dollar spent wisely. But we still have a fewcritical steps to complete the editing process. By sheer magic our show looks like a big-dollar production—but togive it the best chance to get seen, compete with the big dogs and hopefullystart airing(!), we need to clean up the sound, fix the color, and produce astack of DVDs and promotional materials.We’ll post updates over the course of our Kickstarter runand will check in daily to answer any questions you might have about theshow... We could keep typing here, but really all we need to say is THANK YOU. Yourdonation means the completion of a dream that we’ve both had for many, many years—and weabsolutely can’t wait to share Underwater with all of you! 
The Fanalyzers: Views from the Stands|failed|"""The Fanalyzers"" will be a 30 minute weekly sports talk show that focuses on hot sports topics, news and games of the week. Fans today are more astute on sports and their teams. This show provides a venue for fans all over in diverse settings to give their thoughts and opinions on various topics. Filming will be conducted at barbershops, various major sporting events etc. and will focus on the largest demographic in sports - the fan.One of the ""draws"" of ""The Fanalyzers"" is the group's diversity - not only gender and racial, but geographic as well. Everyone in the group is from a different part of the country - therefore providing a different view and vantage point on sports. Currently, there are 15 rotating segments that will be used on the show with the potential for more to be created as the show evolves.  At 100% funding, we will produce ten-webisodes of ""The Fanalyzers"" that we air on the website for the show. Episodes will be ""fresh"" and based on the trending sports news of the time. For example, if will begin shooting in November, an episode may feature talk around NFL games of the week, the start of the NBA season and college football conference match-ups. Games that may be debated will be chosen based on poll-results on the website from fan voting. "

Its a mad dash as we absorb as much of the local culture as possible.Following are some of the locations that we are scouting to film for Season One.  Barcelona, SpainKiev, UkraineVienna, AustriaBuenos Aires, ArgentinaSao Paulo, BrazilMumbai, IndiaSydney, AustraliaTokyo, Japan.With this campaign, you are not backing one episode.  You are backing the entire first season--six episodes!  However, the greater the support we receive through Kickstarter, the more locations we can visit and more episodes we will be able to add to our original planned six.  We would love to hear your ideas for other locations.  What foods/drinks should we experience?  What people should we meet?  Meet the TeamWe are excited to have a strong group of very dynamic, entertaining personalities on-board that produceprojects on stage and screen throughout the United States.  Jonathan Lindsey - Producer, Co-HostDabney Hopkins - Co-HostKaren Vizzard - Co-HostLainey Silver - Co-HostRyan Rahn - Director, CinematographerMiguel Gonzalez - co-Director, CinematographerJesus Valdez - CinematographerKelli Tresgallo - Cinematographer, PhotographerOur Progress So FarSix months ago we began working full time on this project.  In that time we have auditioned for and engaged dynamic hosts and amazingly talented crew.  We have completed location research for Seasons One and Two; researched and planned episodes; and had pre-production meetings in which all cast and crew flew in to collaborate creatively, work through logistics (the inherent chemistry from day one of everyone involved has been amazing), and film promo shots and preliminary material.We have already begun episode 1!  On August 7th, 2013 we began filming the pilot episode on location.  Filming of the episode was completed on August 10th, with post-production currently underway and expected to be complete by September 1st.   This episode alone went amazingly well and we are excited to present to you the full spectrum of experiences we faced, from the awe-inspiring to the downright challenging.Behind the scenes...Production Still (Sound check and last minute notes, June 22, 2013)The Road AheadWe are scheduled to continue principle photography in two-week regional expeditions in October, December, and January.  These regional trips allow us to maximize resources and significantly reduce production costs.  Writing, editing, voice-overs, computer graphics, and other post-production work will occur immediately upon return from each of the filming expeditions.  This will also allow certain efficiencies, but more importantly allow us to deliver Season One in Spring 2014.Here is Where You Come InWe know people love the adventure ofexploring new places and discovering new things, and we know people love tolaugh and be engaged. We are bringing these loves togetherinto this very unique show.As you can see from the still photos and clips, this is already starting to look amazing.  The work we have done sofar has been brought to life by extremely talented artists in front of andbehind the camera.However, the costs of creating a sleek, exceptional series adds up fast.  We aspire to create the highest-possible-qualityentertainment for you and we need YOUR help to do so.Through pledges starting at just $5, you will be involved in the creative process from beginning to end.  You will be able to stay updated on shoots and behind-the-scenes sneak peeks, learn something new, have amazing personal experiences with the hosts, and even join us on location as a guest in an episode...all the while supporting an incredible project and show.Kickstarter GoalsEveryone from cast to crew is donating their time to the project because we believe so much in this project.  But there are some very real costs.  The largest part of our budget is for the expense of transportation of cast and crew to filming locations.  We have therefore set a series of goals that will allow us to make the best possible show for you.Our initial goal of $29,700 will allow us to film and produce a six episode first season.  That may sound like a lot, but in the TV world its not.  If we reach our second goal of $44,550 we will expand the first season to include eight episodes and they will be amazing.  If we reach our third goal of $56,600 we will be able to stretch the first season to 10 episodes that will blow your mind.  Can we exceed our goals?  Yes!  Anything over our initial goals will allow us to keep making the best episodes we possibly can until all funds run out.  Every dollar we raise will be clearly represented on screen.  Everything else will be accomplished by being smart and doing a lot with a little.The RewardsWe have some amazing rewards for everyone at all different levels of support.  We do know that a lot of people will hear of Uncommon Rhythm because of our hosts--the uniquely talented and dynamic on-screen personalities you will see.  So we thought we would also include some rewards that honor that unique-ness.  All of the rewards have been carefully crafted and are exclusive to our Kickstarter Supporters.  Remember, every dollar you pledge goes directly into the series.  By choosing to support the project you are ensuring that we can make an even better project.Note:  Travel, lodging and transportation to events and location visits not included unless specifically stated.  Must be over 18 or accompanied by aparent or legal guardian to attend events (premiere, set visits, specialactivites).  Some rewards may require additional paperwork (to protect us andyou)Where the Money GoesOur largest expenses are related to transportation of cast and crew to filming locations.  Other expenses include:  insurance, permits and legal fees, media storage costs (filming this much material in high-definition requires a lot of digital storage space), and post-production expenses.  Following is our projected budget to film and produce a six episode first season.Other Ways You Can HelpSpread the word!  Tell everyone you know about Uncommon Rhythm.  Like us on Facebook, follow us on Twitter, spread it throughout social media with #uncommonrhythm, blog it, or promote it any way that comes to mind.  Everything helps.If you have location suggestions, or even better ""connections"", with any of the international locations, please email us.  Final ThoughtsWe feel this is an amazing project and think you will too.  We appreciate your time in reading about the show and we appreciate your consideration of any level of support.  Thank you for believing in us and our passion for this project!Sponsors"

Los Angeles International Student Film Festival|successful|What is LA Int'l Student Film Fest?The Los Angeles International Student Film Festival will take place June 7th, 2014. Located in Downtown, Los Angeles at Regal Cinemas LA Live the festival will help deepen the already burgeoning artistic community in downtown by exhibiting student films from not only the Los Angeles area, but from international cities spanning the globe. While there are many film festivals in the LA area there are few dedicated solely to supporting student filmmakers and even less that include high school, undergraduate and graduate students in the same festival. Our programming is aimed towards creating a rich pallet of unique perspectives from around the world thereby exposing our audience to new concepts, stories, and people. LA International Student Film Fest is a project of the Pasadena Arts Council’s EMERGE Fiscal Sponsorship Program. Donations to the festival are tax deductible under Federal ID 95-2540759. The Pasadena Arts Council is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization that has been facilitating, empowering and advocating for the arts since 1964. What your donation will go towards?Our goal here on Kickstarter is to get to $1,500 and we can only do that with your help! The $1,500 will go towards helping us pay for the theater space at Regal Cinemas LA Live where the screenings will take place and for the Closing Ceremony where Student Awards will be announced and filmmakers can network and discuss their work!Any extra donations that take us above our goal will go towards program and operating expenses that make the festival possible and help us create an even better experience for all the audience members and filmmakers involved. Why Support Young Filmmakers?With nationwide budget cuts to education, support for art programs and specifically film programs that require expensive equipment, has become less of a priority to schools who are more focused on students standardized test scores. This in turn leaves students with only half the means they need to achieve a well rounded education and discourages them from self expression that is vital to our societal health and capacity for growth.Throughout history art has been one of our strongest forms of communication and an indicator of what is happening in our society. Now in the twenty first century the art of filmmaking is one of our most capable tools for students to tell their stories through and it is one of the least supported in our school systems.You Can Help Us Provide a Solution. The Los Angeles International Student Film Festival will fill this void by creating support for students where schools may be lacking. We will host an annual film festival dedicated solely to screening work created by students enrolled in high school, undergraduate and graduate programs. By focusing on student films on an international level we are bringing together a global community of filmmakers who share the common goal of education and artistic expression. Through celebrating filmmakers at varying stages in their schooling we strive to create a dynamic environment that offers inspiration and valuable networking opportunities. Most importantly the festival will give talented students a sound board from which to be heard and motivate them to further explore their craft and grow as artists.

PATTY AT THE PARTY - a mumblecore horror feature|failed|"MONGREL COLLECTIVE is a progressive guerrilla movie company in Los Angeles operating outside of Hollywood and the ""indy"" scene. MONGREL is a non profit group who uses high definition technology and the internet to prove that there are alternative ways of making cool movies. We go into a particular environment and collaborate with the community.MONGREL was created by Adam Haynes, a professional screenwriter and graduate of The American Film Institute, one year ago as an attempt to employ the garage punk methodology to making movies. Using craigslist he assembled a core group of multi talented artists and craftsmen. Everyone involved donated their time and their talents and understood that all money spent would be on either food or technical aspects of production, and that all money made would go into further productions or to support the non profit itself.Over the course of the year, two features were made from community donations. The first was a crime thriller titled DIRTY RED HANDS, shot last spring in five days for 500 dollars, and the second was a supernatural thriller called SPIRITEUR, shot last fall in nine days for 800 dollars. Both are currently being edited at MONGREL headquarters. Information and photos related to both movies can be found at either mmmmmongrel.blogspot.com, or by looking up the mmmmmongrel group on facebook.We've learned a lot from making these two features and will be bringing all that knowledge into our third feature, PATTY AT THE PARTY, which will be used to officially launch our website and help get our non profit solvent.For PATTY AT THE PARTY we've partnered up with the Silver/Echo gallery in Echo Park. We workshopped with members of that area's artistic community to create really weird and interesting characters and scenarios, which Adam then used to create a screenplay. PATTY AT THE PARTY is a mumble core horror comedy - think Paul Bartel meets Andrew Bujalski. It tells three separate, interconnected stories about gorgeous, desperate hipsters who, over the course of an afternoon and evening, mistake love for violence, mutilation, and murder.Check out our teaser, which was shot mongrel style on a budget of seven bucks:http://www.youtube.com/watch...Through the fund raising efforts of Silver/Echo as well as community donations we've raised $14,000 for the production proper, which will start in the middle of June. We want to raise at least an additional $5000 to cover post production and marketing needs.MONGREL COLLECTIVE would love to come to your community and make a movie with you and your friends, the sort of movie Hollywood would never make, the sort of movie you've always wanted to see. If you donate to PATTY AT THE PARTY you'll be joining the bigger MONGREL party and helping to make this exciting cinematic revolution possible."
AllThis TV|failed|Making things happen and making a dream come true! This is a show that i have been developing for some time now. It is a comedic, inside look to a job that many people know about, but don't really know how it works.

If I can some how pull off getting this show funded, I know it's going places!As I mentioned before, I've had the script read by several people in the industry and they love it. They love the characters, the writing and the whole foundation and concept of the show. They have no doubt that if I can get this show off the ground, it will get picked up. If I can get the funding for this show, I'll have a complete package developed to pitch it to TV networks once the first season premiers on the web.So what's in it for you? You would be helping support everyone involved in the journey as well as receive credit for helping fund this project. Not only will you have your name appear, you could even receive a shout out at the end of an episode, or better yet, have the chance to appear in an episode!

Spirits Asunder|failed|"SummarySpirits Asunder is a full cinema length feature film being produced and shot in the South coast of England. It is an apocalyptic supernatural thriller.Draft concept for one of the postersThe film is based on the novel, Spirits Asunder, which itself is the first on a series consisting of 3 novels and the producer/writer/director of the film is the author of the novel, as such WE ARE IN A UNIQUE POSITIONCover for the bookHere is the plot outline""The spirit of a deceased young adult returns among the living. His girlfriend, adamant to uncover the truth behind the death closed down by police as undecipherable, enlists the aid of some friends. Together, they conduct a series of seances to make contact with the spirit world, which leads them to a quest.Joining them in their quest is an eccentric genius and an Angel sent from the heavens. When they discover the death is connected to a series of deaths going back over half a century by an entity; a powerful confrontation ensues. But when an ancient evil which had lain dormant for a thousand years is awoken in the process with devastating results, the fate of the entire planet rests on the shoulders of few.""This project has grown beyond what the producer envisioned when the film was conceived and in pre production. We are lucky enough to have on board a talented pool of cast and crew, ranging from those starting in the industry to seasoned veterans.  Plus, we have a professionally composed, cinematic soundtrack from composers who are veterans right at the top of their industry. As such, we have beautifully composed orchestral pieces which range from subtle to epic, depending on scene requirements (Select 'battle scenes' music are pretty epic)One major aspect of the film is the use of Ki energy. Japanese and Chinese study says every living being has energy within them which they use to move around, this is called Ki or Chi energy. In the film, some characters are able to manipulate this energy and bring it forth to be used as a deadly weapon. A  still from a scene in the film showing draft concept of Ki energy for the filmWe have already filmed the vast majority of the production and as such we can guarantee the film will be completed, therefore perks will be given out. But with YOUR help, we can increase the timescale and efficiency in which the film can be released.Production still from one of the seance scenesProduction still from one of the seance scenesConcept art for the angel       Now, without giving too much away at this stage, there is a lead up to an apocalyptic situation, an ""end of the word"" scenario of which the catalyst being a series of seances disturbing the supernatural world. we have a scene where the Prime Minister of the UK calls his cabinet to try and deal with the immeasurable instability of the planet. Of course, the planet's hope rests on the protagonists and the PM's cabinet is limited in what they can do. We are fortunate enough to have on board a talented actor to portray the Prime Minister, who not only looks similar to Prime Minister David Cameron but has portrayed him on national television.What We Need We realise that we have a very modest goal amount for our feature film but as we have completed pre production and a lot of principle photography (filming) is complete, we are well on the road to get the film out. But with help from contributors this can be achieved on a more efficient scale. We still have scenes to film and we still have post productionWhere will the money go?We have very limited on resources, but we have not let that stop us from doing the best we can. With additional funds we can hire additional equipment, contribute towards catering for the cast and crew. But what will really need financing is post production. We plan to utilise top of the range post production software, including motion graphics software, in order to create the special effects, (of which are lighting; earthquakes; Ki energy formations to name a few) to do the film justice. Not to mention financing for the professional, high quality soundtrack. For that, we need to invest in the hardware and software capable of delivering the results the film needs.If we are fortunate enough to reach our goal, we will then stretch it which will then be invested in the camera and lenses budget to give the film an even more cinematic look, as well as money put aside to send to national and international film festivalsWhat you getWe have a range of perks for our supporters. As well as signed posters, T shirts, special pens, we are also offering digital and paperback versions of Spirits Asunder; the novel, a chance to be in the film, video chat with the producer, imdb credits and as well as of course the film itself!LocationAs this is being filmed in Bournemouth, Dorset, the South of England, we have access to naturally beautiful and scenic locations, which we have utilised for the film.       Production still from a scene in the filmThe ImpactWe have very ambitious plans for this project. The film is based on the novel so of course the novel will be released. We also have plans for a radio adaptation, Spirits Asunder themed merchandise, a spin off web series and potentially a theatre adaptation if we can generate enough interest.If the film does well, we hope to secure investment and funding for the sequels. Should we be fortunate enough to get to that stage, we plan to offer our fans and supporters the opportunity to get involved with the production and receive perks!So at the end of the day, you aren't just supporting a film, you are supporting an entertainment package!Other Ways You Can HelpIf you wish to help this project in non-financial means, please spread the word, link  our facebook page and our campaign page.Thanks!Cast Please visit our imdb page for cast details"

Kaleidoscope Man|failed|Hi, I’m Simon Cox, the writer and director of a thrilling new science fiction movie, Kaleidoscope Man.  When I was a child and saw the original Star Wars, it changed my life. I knew then that I wanted to be a film director and that some day I would make a sci-fi movie that would thrill, inspire and blow audiences away - just like Star Wars did for me...Kaleidoscope Man is that sci-fi movie...I am now in my forties and have been a director and editor for over 20 years. I started in children’s television as an editor, cutting UK TV shows like; The Wombles, Astro Farm and Treasure Island. This gave me a fantastic grounding in visual story telling and how to actually put films together. Since then I directed the feature film, Written in Blood, and made a huge amount of short films and corporate productions. But my one true passion is still to make that epic sci-fi movie, and at last my dream project, Kaleidoscope Man, is ready to shoot.   It has taken me years to develop the script for Kaleidoscope Man and I have worked hard to find that “thing” that makes films magical - and it hasn't been simple. My first feature film, Written in Blood, was a tough film to make and could have done with another 6 months script development, so it has been vital that I get the script for Kaleidoscope Man perfect.KALEIDOSCOPE MAN - THE STORYAfter the death of his young daughter, THOMAS DUNN is a man who has lost his faith. His life has crumbled and his confidence is shattered. But on this day he wakes to discover that MANDY, his loving wife is finally pregnant again. Maybe this is their chance to move away from the tragedy of the past and for him to find his faith again. But on his way to his job as a doctor at a care centre for people with mental health problems, Tom has a horrific vision; fire, destruction and the end of the Earth. Unbeknown to Tom, Mandy, who is a teacher at a primary school, has had the same vision. As Tom arrives at the care centre, he discovers that three of his patients have also had the same vision; HARRIET, an angry lady with a narcissistic personality disorder,  FLOYD, a paranoid schizophrenic, and SAMANTHA, a goth and a manic depressive. Tom is baffled, why them?   Fear and paranoia sets in as people across the world discuss the visions that only some of them have experienced. Then, like an omen of doom, a new star appears in the heavens. As telescopes point skywards, the people of Earth finally learn that they are not alone in the universe. The star is a gigantic spaceship. Tom wants out of the city, as quickly as possible and tries to call Mandy, but the two of them miss each others phone calls. As the sun sets, a small venomous four legged harvester spaceship attacks the hospital and abducts Tom, Floyd, Harriet and Samantha. The harvester races upwards and takes them aboard the mother-ship which hovers above the Earth. Tom, Floyd, Harriet and Samantha are forced into pods and then put into each others deepest thoughts and fantasies. Here they discover the horrific truth as to the visions, why they were abducted and why THEY were chosen. The mother-ship launches a massive assault on the Earth, sending out millions of harvester craft to collect up the inhabitants of Earth, and put them in pods within the belly of the mother-ship.Tom discovers that he must look deep within himself to find not just his faith, but the wisdom and strength to save the human race, from the horrors that threaten them. And somehow, he must do this with the help of his three patients. But first, he must save Mandy and their unborn child, as together they hold the future of the human race. The battle lines are drawn and the final stance for Earth is about to begin... SOME BACK STORY ABOUT THE MOVIEI tried to get Kaleidoscope Man off the ground a few years ago but had difficulties securing the finance. A local funding body, Screen West Midlands, gave me a grant to shoot a pilot and get the fantastic concept art done.YOU CAN WATCH THE FULL PILOT HERE:SHOOTING LOCATIONSA large part of the film is set on Earth and will be shot in London, Birmingham and Coventry. I have done a lot of location scouting and have the interior and exterior shooting locations pretty well organised. There is a section set on an alien planet which we plan to shoot on the island of Lanzarote (see www.kaleidoscopeman.com/locations). This is a barren landscape which was covered in lava over 200 years ago and looks incredibly lunar like. A small group of us will go over there for around four days to shoot these scenes.CGI SPECIAL EFFECTSWhen we made the pilot, I worked with two highly skilled CGI animators, Dave Ledsom and Stuart Burnicott, with them and our concept artist, Matt Allsopp, we designed and built all of the CGI spaceship interiors and exteriors. The same team will come on board and complete the CGI for us on the final film.The special effects work should take around 6 to 9 months to complete.A chunk of the film will be shot against a green screen and for this we have access to a local, purpose built chroma-key shooting stage which we will hire for around two weeks.I will keep our Facebook page regularly updated with the films progress, including the special effects.THE CASTWe do not have the cast in place yet, so plan to cast the film early in 2013. Actors need shooting dates and when we have set a date, we have a casting director friend, who will help us to find our actors. We will ensure that we get very experienced, powerful actors, who are passionate about their craft and who are perfect for their character roles.CAMERA EQUIPMENTOver the years I have built up my own business making corporate and event videos. This has enabled me to build up some top end filming and editing equipment which will help to keep the production costs down, and to pretty much finish the film in house.  Here is my day job website: www.alphastarproductions.com   HOW WE PLAN TO USE YOUR MONEYIf this Kickstarter campaign is successful and we manage to raise the minimum of £60,000 I plan to shoot the film for £40,000 and get the special effects done with the other £20,000. My hope is that we can raise much much more.Everybody will be paid a basic wage to work on the film. The main shoot will take approximately 3 weeks and the special effects approximately 6 to 9 months.KALEIDOSCOPE MAN REWARDSCheck out the video below for more information about the rewards you will get for supporting Kaleidoscope Man:I have added the script as a perk, and the cost for this is basically to send out a signed hard copy. All I ask is that you please don’t put it on the internet, at least, not until the film is finished and is out in the big wide world. Thank you.WANT TO BE ABDUCTED BY ALIENS..?Check out the video below which shows the animation pre-vis for the alien abduction sequence. The numbered pods are 1st Class and the others (with windows) are 2nd class.

STREETFIGHTERZ WHEELIE MURICA|undefined|So as we said, after 15 years of chaos, we decided we want to travel across the western half of our awesome country and wheelie the whole way. We've traveled extensively across the eastern portion of the country, but for reasons to difficult to explain, we've never made it west. Not knowing how long the gears and motors in our bikes will last, we want to wheelie our way to the pacific ocean. And of course, bring you along for every turn in the trip. We promise not to use the VCR's and VHS tapes from our early days, we've upgraded over the years, but with a little help from KickStarter, we're excited about bringing you the experience in the best possible quality and sound available.We've dreamed about a trip like this for years, and thought what better way to give back to our friends and fans for the years of support than to give them a behind the scenes look of a life time. The ultimate end goal, is a documentary style DVD, with more action, wild times, and whatever else happens all packed together. The problem obviously comes with the expense of the RV Rental, lodging, gas, food, tickets, production, etc. If we can get these expenses covered, we'll be able to focused completely on the riding, filming, planning, coordination, and everything else. As always, we love the support more than you know and hope to wheelie into the sunset soon!

"Launch ""Romeo and Juliet in Yiddish"" in New York City"|failed|"""Romeo and Juliet in YIddish"" is an ambitious, colorful, complex feature dramedy shot on the RED. It is the first American feature film 55% in colloquial YIddish in 70 years. With a budget to date of 175K it has galvanized audiences in Berlin, where it won the Gerhardt Klein Audience Award, London, and New York where it played to sold out houses at Lincoln Center at the New York Jewish Film Festival. (Please see Press Links!) Now its slated for a REAL WEEK LONG RUN at the pinnacle of Eastern Seaboard culture: the NEW CINEMA COMPLEX OF THE FILM SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER, the David Rockwell designed   (he designs the Oscar sets!!!!!! ), Eleanor  Bunin Monroe Film Center  starting July 8th. Can you say ""Brass Ring""?? So, in June: the Opening film for the Montreal Festival of Yiddish Culture at the Segal Centre in Montreal,  then Bucharest, then the annual Yiddish hoe down in Krakow, then Lincoln Center, and Israel in the Fall in the Compeition at The Jewish Eye at Ashkelon, (city of Spuds, here we come!) Not bad! Additionally, ""Romeo"" has become a subject of study for noted Shakespearologist Dr. Mark Burnett, who has the following to say: 'Exhilarating, intricate and intelligent, Romeo and Juliet in Yiddish takes Shakespeare where he has rarely been before. Both an adaptation of Romeo and Juliet, and a coming-of-age story premised on an imagined performance of the Bard's most famous play, the film brilliantly transposes the conflict and romance of ancient tragedy to the Hasidic communities of New York. In so doing, the film revitalizes the tale of 'star-crossed lovers' while simultaneously hinting at the need for larger kinds of understanding in today's society. Delightfully multi-layered and self-conscious, this is a film responsive to the concerns of today, mixing, as it does, the pressures of tradition, the sounds of rhythms of popular culture, and the lures and energies of the modern city. An innovative and attuned Shakespeare for our times.  Professor Mark Thornton Burnett, Queen's University, Belfast, Northern Ireland, UK'Jim Hoberman's made it a ""Voice Choice"" http://www.villagevoice.com/2011-01-05/voice-choices/romeo-and-juliet-in-yiddish/#http://yiddish.forward.com/node/3436.

Climbing 4 Kidz|failed|We are wanting to bring the vision to reality as we hope that this film will inspire children to find their inner climber instead of staying on the couch in front of TV.  As we did with our children, this film will show all aspects of what climbing is or what it can be for a child. This film is mainly focused on our youth, (but will show adults alike, how fun Climbing can be) showing them what the climbing world can bring, where it may take them, the people they may meet along the way, and the proper use of gear. Seen as the film is being done for children we will not be focusing on only one element of climbing, this will be showing manying different types of climbing, including Bouldering, Lead, Top-Roping, and Rappelling.

Nurse Mare Foals: Born to Die|successful|"HOW TO HELPThis documentary will reveal the cruel secret that some in the various equine breeding industries don’t like to acknowledge or talk about: Every year during breeding season, hours-old, non-pedigreed foals are taken from their mothers, whose job is to be a nurse mare to a pedigree foal.This cycle continues, over and over. The foals with championship potential are nourished by nurse mare’s milk critical to the health and survival of a baby horse. But what happens to the non-pedigreed and discarded foals? Many are left to die. Victoria Goss and her small crew save about 150 foals during foaling season every January through June. Working directly with a few nurse mare farms in Southern Ohio and Kentucky, they pick up eight to ten foals at a time as soon as they get a phone call. Leaving at dawn with an empty horse trailer, they return in late afternoon with a new batch of hours-old foals ready to be cared for, nursed to health and readied for adoption. Victoria’s low 2 percent mortality rate astounds veterinarians. When the foals are stabilized, they are adopted by those qualified in equine care and housing. Some have become stars in their own right as therapy horses.In October 2010, I volunteered at Last Chance Corral in Athens, Ohio, to muck stalls and help stock hay into one of the three barns on the property. Little did I know nor understand what this horse rescue organization has done since 1991. When I fully grasped the plight of the nurse mare foals, I was still drop-jawed with questions. Telling this story about the heroic work performed by Last Chance Corral founder Victoria Goss has become my passion. I need your help. Without this Kickstarter, future work on this documentary is in jeopardy. But more importantly, creating awareness about the nurse mare foals will not be possible and more horses will die. Born to Die is currently just under 11-minutes in length (which became my master's project at Ohio University in 2012). It is my goal to create a 30-minute feature that expands the story to show the viability of these horses.All expenses have been out of pocket. It's what we do for the love of a story, right? Kickstarter funding will be used for documented expenses that have helped create the current story, which include equipment,  travel, transportation and meals to Athens, Ohio. Post-production editing is a large part of what is ahead. Also built into the funding are expenses for gifts, shipping and fees for Kickstarter (5%) and Amazon (3-5%). I hope you will join me in telling this important story. Let's create awareness and save lives. Thank you for any support you are able to give. REWARDS AND GIFTSSCREEN SAVER IMAGESResting foal at Last Chance Corral, Athens, OhioIn the foal barn at Last Chance Corral, Athens, Ohio.PRINTS DONATED FOR THIS KICKSTARTER PROJECTA heartfelt thank you to my photojournalist colleagues who have spent much of their careers documenting horses and equine lifestyles.

The Bird Nerd|successful|WE JUST HIT OVER £1000!!! Thanks to all who have donated!We all have a competitor at something we love, whether that be sports, video game leader boards or, for some, bird watching.Alan Argus has the dream of being the local bird watching legend, however: the cunning Bernie Samson currently sits at the throne. He's won Bird watcher of the month award eleven times in a row, and won't stop bragging that he's about to make it to twelve.And this weekend turns out to be primetime for bird watchers; Coco Cola's parrot mascot Coco, from the adverts on TV, has escaped and is on the loose.Determined now not to miss this opportunity, Alan packs his camera, binoculars and some warm clothes as he camps out all night, waiting for Coco.The Bird Nerd shows that no matter what you're passionate about, and whatever gets in your way there's always light at the end of the tunnel.The Bird Nerd is a short comedy film being made by 16-20 year olds from across the UK, all of whom have been handpicked by the National Film and Television School as the next generation of British Filmmakers.Our absolutely bare minimum budget for the film is just £400. Any excess money we raise will go toward hiring out more elaborate props and costumes, in order to give the film a sense of slightly hightened reality and hence greater production values. At the moment, the majority or our budget considers: a) hiring out some awesome locations in the Herefordshire countryside; b) hiring techincal equipment such as lights and grip equipment; c) transport for all of our amazing crew from across the UK to attend the shoot.Will (middle), our Director.

The Great Kentucky Goblin Spree|successful|You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.PlayReplay with soundPlay with  sound00:0000:00 Teaser TrailerOfficial Poster    The Great Kentucky Goblin Spree is inspired by true events and set in the backwoods of Kentucky in 1955. It's about two families, the patriarchs of which happen to be brothers, coming together for a low-key family reunion and in the process are besieged late in the night by visitors from a spacecraft that crash lands near the cabin on their property. Instead of hiding under their beds or heading for the hills like most normal people are prone to do, it becomes an all night standoff consisting of copious amounts of moonshine and gunfire.   We've reached the point in our project where we cannot proceed without funding. Due to our locations being limited (the majority of the film takes place on the property) we had the luxury of building the cabin interior set in a warehouse that was provided for us. The materials used were donated by Le Chat Noir, a local black box theatre, and were pieces of previously used sets from their past productions. Now that our interior scenes are complete it's time to move on to the exterior scenes. And that's gonna cost money.   First, we need an exterior set, and that's going to consist of a cabin. Since we have filmed our interior scenes and also plan on taking the majority of that set with us to the property (also donated to us) we only need to build the exterior of the house. But it will still be an expensive endeavor. We also have no electricity as we will be shooting in a remote location so generators will be needed to power the many lights needed. We also need a non-running early-1950's era truck and money for additional costumes. Up until this point I have fed the cast and crew out of my own pocket but I assume we will have longer shoots now that we're on location and additional meals will be a necessity.The Great Kentucky Goblin Spree T-ShirtYou can visit our official Facebook page here: https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Great-Kentucky-Goblin-Spree/1403873309851103 Like us!You can also learn more about Le Chat Noir here: http://www.lcnaugusta.com
Opening Portals DVD|failed|"We have found evidence that portals exist!In the spring months of 2011, UFO researcher Nigel Mortimer witnessed an extraordinary event - two military jets that were chasing a silvery ball of light over the woodlands of Settle in North Yorkshire, England. Shortly afterwards, he watched a ghost like owl appear out of nowhere, it sat staring at him with large dark eyes, within those same woods. He soon found out that other locals in the township had been observing these same lightships descending into the treetops for years. Intrigued by these sightings, Nigel began to explore the woodland with his wife Helen, but they initially found nothing unusual apart from the massive outcrop of rock known as Castleberg, which hung silently, looming over the small market town for thousands of years. More UFO sightings were reported and all of them seemed to be originating from the wooded craggy slopes of that place.Nigel came across an old painting and map of the Settle area which showed something unusual at Castleberg which was no longer there; a line of four massive ancient standing stones that ran down the hillside. His further investigations revealed that in the 1600's the British government mysteriously made an effort to remove these stones and replace them with something else on the landscape which would erase all living memory of the original Settle Sun Dial. Four hundred years later, Nigel Mortimer rediscovered where the secret sun dial had been placed, why it had been covered up, removed from the landscape and what its true purpose was - A PORTAL to another world!The secret that inter dimensional portals exist has been kept hidden away from the general public. The elite know that this is the preferred mode of transportation into our reality for the ET visitors. The amazing video and photographic evidence that has been gained by the Mortimer's at this portal site is groundbreaking! No longer can the truth be hidden.....ET Communication at the Sun Dial Portal WE NEED HELP TO BRING THIS TRUTH TO YOU!""A few months after the portal site was rediscovered,  I became very ill. I could not breath properly and all of my energy was zapped from my body. I was taken to hospital twice with these symptoms but no definite solution to my illness was found. I suffered that illness for two years. I thought I was going to die.... I did not tell the doctors that I had been cursed with this illness from a negative human spirit from the 1600's at the portal!""  Even though there had been many setbacks like this throughout 2011 to 2013, which included personal attacks by the local council, my self funded book on the portal being banned from all shops and libraries in the locality, and further psychic warnings, my wife and I continue to search for the truth. The illness has caused me to be unfit for physical work and so we have struggled on little income during this time, but even so, we have continued to work at the portal and spread the word about the amazing things we have discovered there. Much of this documented video evidence will make up part of the whole story behind the documentary we will produce. In essence, we have already captured the heart of this story.Now we need more funds to finish shooting and editing the rest of this film during 2014, so that we can get it out into the world! It is so important that we do this soon - we understand now, that there are none human life forms which exist,  that depend on this truth and They have been waiting a very long time to be invited into this physical realm!The Sun Dial that never was! ONE MORE UFO DOCUMENTARY...HOW WILL THIS ONE BE DIFFERENT? When we said that this documentary will be groundbreaking, they were not empty words. There has never been a ground roots film like this one, which gives both an accurate account of the history behind the cover up of a real portal, but also goes on to describe with amazingly detailed evidence that portals like the one found at Settle are still being used by inter dimensional Beings. Many of them are like us, some of them rather stranger lifeforms. Nigel Mortimer is no New Age weirdo, he has 30 years of UFO investigations and research under his belt and what happened to him at Settle was a shock to him!  The extraordinary synchronicity of separate witnesses  accounts from the portal site is only the tip of the iceberg. This will not be a typical UFO documentary. This film will show how history and science often converge into the phenomenal worlds of the paranormal. After viewing this film, science will not be able to simply ignore the truth. We hope that science will embrace it. The Mortimer's know what happened and aren't waiting for anyone to prove it to them. They have the evidence. More extraordinary than the evidence is the effect the whole experience has had on all of our lives and the impact it will have on the immediate future of humankind. Nigel confronts negative energies at the portal... Photographic Evidence from the portal can be viewed here:   https://plus.google.com/photos/112863780699861612176/albums/5928410803933528545?authkey=CMaJidueosTEFgNigel's Book about the Portals coming soon...."
Piero Marsili|failed|Piero Marsili Libelli A look through and behind his lensTo see is to make a change, and whose pictures have the power to change the way we see.Marsili began his career in the seventies in Milan working with the BBC photographing crime. He later moved toRome, where he started working with L'Espresso (An Italian weekly news magazine. It is one of the two most prominent Italian weeklies, the other being Panorama) He then began to travel, reporting across Africa, India, Japan and  Pakistan as well as dealing with some of the great directors from the avant-garde theatre, such as Michelangelo Antonioni, Francesco Rosi, Giuliano Montaldo, Marco Ferreri and most recently Vittorio Storaro to film Caravaggio.The documentary will be composed of four different shooting styles, two of which we will re-create and two  which will be more natural and real. I would like to document a week with Piero and life as he perceives it. The film will be surreal like one aspect of his art, and the interviews composed of dialogues taking place in both normal and extraordinary situations.1.An introduction to Italian magical realism and how it’s done. The photographer on set, his interaction with the  subjects, the first glimpse into his mind, and to end a staged interview where he tells us past stories about his sets. 2. War, Piero tells us about his experience. With the use of sounds we will in building up a momentum for this, Piero’s mind drifts. Him in any given situation (drinking a coffee, walking in the street, etc) his eyes fixed on something, camera movement will always be the same or similar - a long far away take that moves around crowded spaces to end with the photographer. When the shot ends, we will have the continuation of narration and war photos will enter the frame.3. His inspiration. Piero and what inspires him - we will film short clips of two to fifteen seconds, in multiple locations around Puglia. A day or more driving around everywhere looking for places, Piero taking photos, finding amazing locations, creating beautiful compositions and seeing the man work for a photo that is not staged.  4. On and off the stage. Stories of him photographing in theatre, movie sets, and on set in general. Piero in real life: from him cooking, to him having breathing problems due to his smoking habit. Him and his wife spending time together at home, going through photos on his computer. His framed photos, the house they live in, the light hitting the pictures hanging throughout the house, him walking between roomsEstimated duration between around 10 - 12 minutesThe short documentary will create awareness of Marsili. 
LEGO Imagination Lab|failed|"""Too many people grow up. That's the real trouble with the world, too many people grow up. They forget. They don't remember what it's like to be 12 years old...""-Walt DisneyI think we can all agree that as children (and maybe currently) our imagination worked at its best when we brought our toys to life. I want to capture this dream, and use my skills to bring our toys alive in the best ways possible. Join me as I share stories and values with some of the world's favorite toys. Your backing will help me complete five, five minute stop action Lego videos. These videos will be distributed for free to Lego Builder's Clubs in elementary school's around the nation. Currently, my thirty second videos are being shown in the University Place School District in Washington State. But with your funding, I can make longer, better quality videos, that I can send to teachers in at least five different states. Your help will get the momentum started. I aim to inspire the youth, and adults, of this age. And you can join the magic! Your money will specifically aid me in acquiring: better camera lenses $200-600             - The quality of the camera lens directly effects the production quality of the video. I believe my value comes from the story, but also and equally from the sharpness and composition of the images.  The software (DragonFrame) $295            - This is the software I currently use, however I can only afford the free 30 day trial, which is vastly limiting. When the month is over, I loose the ability to create my videos at their current quality. By owning this software, I can make videos longer than thirty seconds (my 5 minute goal) and as time progresses, I can explore creating vastly longer adventures!Recording Microphone $150          - In my videos, I wish to insert dialogue and music. The microphone will record different actor's voices. To avoid copyright conflicts, I will also record original music for the videos. For this price, I can purchase a zoom recorder with the ability to record everything at studio quality. Adobe Creative Cloud Suite $30/month         - Adobe Creative Cloud gives me vast and endless resources. I currently use Adobe Premiere software to edit the videos, and make use of After Effects, Photoshop, Lightroom, and Muse. It also gives me a domain name for my own web page. Without this powerful tool, making these videos would be pointless. Materials (Clay, lights, tripods, props)         - Each set is made in intricate detail with modeling clay, lighting, and Legos or any other appropriate material for a compelling scene. Your backing will provide me with a flexible budget to create immersing worlds for each video.and most importantly, LEGO sets!           - Of course, I need the Legos to make the movies!!! These don't have to be purchased new. I accept donated Legos. I also plan to purchase second hand Legos. In our education system, I firmly believe the encouragement to imagine is lacking. Too many children are pushed through the system, loosing touch with their dreams as a child. Those dreams were what made us happiest, and those dreams should never be suppressed. Get back in touch with your inspirations and dreams, and help me inspire others. Dreaming is a dangerous thing, because it can better the world in infinite ways. Never stop being a kid. Never stop playing. "

We still need some visual effects to achieve specific looks and style that we want. Beyond that, our goal is to get the movie in as many festivals as possible but that is, unfortunately, a costly venture. Although, some festivals are free, many festival fees (especially ""top tier"" ones) can cost anywhere from $20-$80, plus requiring media and promotional materials.

At Home in Maine: A Film Series About Homebirth and Midwives|failed|"On December 27, 2004 I had a homebirth with my son in rural Montville, Maine assisted by two Certified Professional Midwives. The portraitremains vivid.  The windowpanes frosted, a waning full moon shiningthrough.  Candles and Christmas tree lightsilluminate the room like a temple.  The birthing tub next to the Christmastree.  The woodstove nearly red with heat.  The only sounds:  my moansand roars, urges I could never supress.  My midwife breathing beside me,holding the space.  That last push—the one I thought would never come—myson emerging from my body, into the water and into his father’s waitinghands.  Two births.  My son. And me, as a Mother. My birth experience completely transformed and empowered me.  I began to care about the world a whole lot more.  I came to recognize that most women in the US did not have this kind of birth experience I did.  Why is this?  Highly medicalized birth, with a dangerously high rate of intervention, including a rate of C-section hovering at around 33%.  Also, persistent marginalization and misrepresentation in the mainstream media around birth (and homebirth) with the message:  birth is a crisis, birth must be feared, birth hurts, birth must happen in the hospital.I am filmmaker.  I felt compelled to create a film that would challenge these assumptions, that would provide a picture of how birth can be, that would give women and their partners more information about the choice to have a homebirth.Four years later, there are eleven films.  The fruit of this labor is ""At Home in Maine"", an online documentary film series about homebirth and midwifery care.  The films present authentic, intimate, artistic portraits of the homebirth experience.  They are meant to educate and inform, challenge the myths--and inspire.  All the films are accessible online:  www.mainehomebirth.wordpress.com  ""At Home in Maine"" is part of a vibrant grassroots Natural Birth Movement that seeks to transform the way the US sees birth.  Does birth.I aim to keep adding to the ""At Home in Maine"" series, to expand this growing body of work--to show that homebirth happens.  That means more families, more midwives and more locations.  To show that homebirth is a safe and viable choice for women and their families.  That it is normal.  The funding from this successful Kickstarter campaign will be used to create four more films for the ""At Home in Maine"" series.  Funds will cover production (mileage, equipment costs, supplies, time) and post-production expenses (editing and output).  By the summer of 2012, I hope to increase the number of films in the series to fifteen.  I am already in production on the next homebirth film--with a mother who gave birth at home earlier this month--and have several other families interested in participating in this project.  ""At Home in Maine"" is not just for Mainers!  The film series has attracted a global audience that extends well-beyond Maine's borders, with viewers from countries as far-flung as Russia, Iraq and Indonesia.  There's no place like home! And ""At Home in Maine"" is not just about homebirth.  It's for anyone who wants a picture of normal, natural, woman-centered birth.  Images have the power to change the way we see the world.  The way we see and do birth.Since my homebirth experience, I havebeen spellbound, transfixed, held in the sway of the transformativepower of it all:  of birth, humancapacity and magic.  My own birth was not recorded, yet, I play the sequenceagain and again in my memory.  Itcalms me on a fitful night of sleep. I create films about homebirth to preserve that experience, to acknowledgethe beauty and spirituality, to show what is possible, to witness that beautyand magic over and over again.  I film to love women and our bodies, toshow birth as creation; to see birth as art.Thank you for your support of this project!"

Lego Batman: Zombie Genesis Series|successful|The General Idea.I would like for this Batman Zombie animation to spawn a successful online series. I have almost graduated university and it would be good to get something going online that was my own creation. Both Batman and Zombies are very popular themes online at the moment, especially in the lego universe.£200 Total Goal Stretch.I can't believe how fast you all helped me reach my goal! I can now afford to create the full hospital set for the first series that I designed myself. Not only this but I can have more characters, not only more but higher quality, this is fantastic!Unfortunately I had some bad luck with my camera lens and it is now slightly damaged. I can still make the series, I was filming just before I wrote this update. Basically there is a big blue mark appearing in the center of images every time I take a picture. My work around for this is that I can film from more of a distance then just crop the footage in post production, the camera I am using is an amazing piece of equipment, so the image resolution is fine to do this without loosing any quality.I am worried the damage could get worse, as it is basically an issue that has grown(this was a second hand lens to begin with). If I can raise the extra funds I will use them to purchase another lens for the camera which will make filming so much more easy.Examples of my work.Before I get into details, here are two examples of my work so far with Lego. The first video took a single day to make and the second only took 4 or 5 days. What Will Your Funding Go To?The funds will be used simply to purchase the required bits and pieces for the film. Example given, a batman lego figure costs around £8. I already have my own camera and equipment to make the film so that's not a problem. I also fully own all the software that is needed. I have enough things to make episode 1 but after that I will hit a brick wall so to speak.Further DetailsThe episodes would be about 150 seconds in length each and special characters from the dc universe would be featured throughout the series. The first series as a test run for popularity would run for 5 episodes.The general outline of the whole thing has been scripted and planned.I actually already have the parts to make episode one. Its more of the series that I will need support to develop until it grows in popularity.I made a Youtube channel only a week ago and already have over 200 subs, so the videos are spreading quite fast for a new youtuber! Would be great to get a new memorable project out there.
Digitizing My Family|successful|I love my family. They have shaped who I am, and each one of them holds a hint of who I will become. I'm so lucky to live in a time when I have more than memories, more than words... I have old videos and film.Every VHS tape, every foot of 8mm film, is an opportunity to discover ourselves. Why we are who we are. I'm in the process of digitizing my family's history - Specifically the pile of VHS and Hi8 tapes we have (over 50 in all!). More exciting, my grandfather and his brother, an avid videographer back in the day, filmed a large collection of 8mm videos that I currently have in my possession.Once these films and videos are digitized, I will be putting together short films. Little windows into our family. Short documentaries featuring interviews with different family members. Films that explore facets of my life. These films will be available for all to see online.To digitize and preserve these films properly requires expensive equipment and a professional hand, and will take up a bulk of the fund goal. Here is a partial list of what is needed to truly begin this project in earnest.- Digitize and archive over 3,000 feet of 8mm films- Acquire the hardware needed to digitize and preserve the VHS and Hi8 Tapes- Purchase hard drives for storage and archiving- Acquire additional software for proper treatment of the videos- Outsource transcription/translation services- Purchase blu-rays or digital tapes for archivingThis project has been weighing on my heart heavily since I was young. It has been difficult to raise funds on my own because of the sheer expense of hard drive space; special hardware needed to digitize the tapes; software to edit; and other odds and ends.

Lei|successful|Hi, my name's Georgia, the Writer and Director of Lei.Lei is a film inspired by my experiences going home after two years at University. Reconnecting with old friends I realised exactly how far apart a lot of us had grown in such a short time. It led me to explore what would happen to people who grew up in a very small, claustrophobic town and then suddenly left, only to be reunited at a friend's funeral. For these reasons the film holds a very personal theme for me and is one I am incredibly excited to be making. I am hugely inspired by directors like Steve McQueen and Terrance Malick, i believe they make incredible films about simple stories but they do them so so well. I plan to make a visually and emotionally arresting film. I love natural lighting, i love nature and wide open spaces and icant wait to show off the English coast! We are now mostly cast and are on a 9th draft of the script! The project is really beginning to take off and we just need your help to complete it to the best of our abilities! I have very high hopes for this film and really believe that it can be a festival screening piece, we just need the ability to make it!Music in Video (thanks!): TITLE: Wings ARTIST: NICOLAI HEIDLASYour Funding.Your funding is so important to us. The project is ambitious but has real potential to be a beautiful piece of story telling, if allowed the right tools. One of these is the actors, the people who carry the story and in an ensemble piece like this are incredibly important to get right. We want to use the funding to draw in the best people we can. The other thing we need help with is the cost of travelling to the stunning locations near by. We understand the compromises between a stunning location and where we can get to but, with your help, you will allow us to access more beautiful places.It will also allow us to particpate in film festivals, and get our work out there to new people as i feel the film has real potential!We are dedicated, professional and determined to make an award winning film about themes I believe in.

Peripheral vision - short film|successful|We're making our final film for our final year of university. The film is set in 2020 in Sydney, Australia, a time when a curfew has been placed on women so that they can't walk the streets alone at night. Our protagonist, an influential media personality who is strongly against the curfew is attacked in her own home by a man who wants to limit her voice and power. The genre is a drama/thriller. We hope that our film makes a strong comment on the way that victim blaming is so prevalent in today's society, and it cannot be tolerated. We are in need of some extra money in order to get some quality equipment to film with, buy props, get make-up artists, feed the cast and crew and so on. Any donations would make so much difference!
STAGNANT POOL enters post-production|successful|You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.PlayReplay with soundPlay with  sound00:0000:00!! Version Française sous l'anglais !!ABOUT THE DIRECTOR On the set of Stagnant PoolAfter premiering my collaborations (POLET, LE CYCLE) with creative agency TRUSST exclusively on DAZED DIGITAL in 2009, I have continued to explore the body, identity and sexuality in a series of personal experimental shorts. Stagnant Pool explores a series of new themes explained below.I have also gone on to creating commercial work for international brands such as ALDO, L'OREAL, SSENSE, DIESEL, BIOTERM & SID LEE.My work has been screened in various festivals including in Paris, Milan, London, Amsterdam, Lisbon and Brussels, Toronto and Montreal.Nico Archambault stars as NarcissusThe film's star, dancer and choreographer Nico Archambault was the first performer to win So You Think You Can Dance Canada and has gone on to dance for Janet Jackson amongst others, star in several feature length movies and produce his own television show on Radio Canada.INSPIRATIONIt was during my time in university, studying Communications, that I became interested in behavioral shifts resulting from new technologies. While writing a paper about the impact of social media on human interaction, I stumbled upon a book by Twenge and Campbell, where they cite statistics showing that diagnosis for Narcissistic Personality Disorder has tripled within the last decade. They associated this increase to the rise of social media whose interface/structure imposes a focus on ones self.--C’est pendant mes études universitaires en Communications que j’ai commencé à m’intéresser aux changements de comportement des gens résultant des nouvelles technologies.En rédigeant un travail sur l’impact des médias sociaux sur les interactions humaines quotidiennes, je suis tombé sur un livre de Twenge et Campbell où l’on mentionnait que le Trouble de la personnalité narcissique avait triplé dans la dernière décennie. Les auteurs associaient cette augmentation à l’émergence des médias sociaux, dont la structure et l’interface sont très centrées sur l’image personnelle.THE FILM/ LE FILMReading up on the symptoms of NPD, it occurred to me that the myth of Narcissus would be interesting adapting into a dance film. Reinterpreting a familiar tale was a great exercise for exploring linear storytelling through my signature aesthetic, something I had never done before.  Rather than purely making a film about dance in a location other than the stage, I wanted to take full advantage of the medium and have the dance come in at the climax of a storyline. The overall tone of the film will be very theatrical and moody. It takes an even more surreal turn after Narcissus falls under the spell of his own reflection.A lot of the choreography references the psychological profile of a person with NPD. Certain elements of the original fable were modified to make parallels to today's current trends in social media. --Le fait de réinterpréter une histoire familière a été une opportunité pour moi d’explorer une forme narrative plus linéaire tout en conservant mon esthétique personnelle, chose que je n’avais jamais faite auparavant.Au lieu de simplement faire un film sur la danse dans un contexte autre que la scène, j’ai voulu prendre pleinement avantage du médium et insérer la danse au point culminant du scénario. L’ambiance du film sera très théâtrale et riche en émotions. L’histoire prend un tournant encore plus surréaliste lorsque Narcisse tombe sous le sort de son propre reflet.Une partie importante de la chorégraphie fait référence au profil psychologique d’une personne souffrant du TPN. De plus, certains éléments du mythe de Narcisse ont été modifiés afin de faire des parallèles avec les tendances actuelles dans les médias sociaux.LOCATION + ART DIRECTION// LIEU DE TOURNAGE + DIRECTION ARTISTIQUE The film was shot in the alien landscapes of Quarry Island within the Mingan Archipelago near Havre St. Pierre in Quebec and features Archambault starring alongside four dancers and choreography by Street Parade. Costumes were designed by Montreal-based designer Duy and Travis Taddeo.--Le film fût tourné dans le paysage étrange de l’Île de Quarry de l’archipel Mingan, près de Havre-Saint-Pierre. Il met en vedette Nico Archambault accompagné de quatre danseurs, chorégraphiés par Street Parade. Les costumes ont été confectionnés par les designers montréalais Duy et Travis Taddeo. BUDGET BREAKDOWN / BUDGET DÉTAILLÉI was lucky to get a grant from the CALQ for 7000$.  An extra 6000$ were required to shoot the film on location. We estimate to complete the film with a final 7500$.Due to the harsh weather conditions on the last day of shooting, an important scene must be re-shot. Luckily, the shot can be recreated in studio. The money raised here will go towards the one day re-shoot, the completion of sound design and score and some special effects required in the script--J’ai eu la chance de recevoir une bourse de 7000$ du CALQ pour ce projet. Il a fallu 6000$ de plus pour aller tourner à l’Île de Quarry, et j’estime qu’il faudra 7500$ supplémentaires pour compléter le film.À cause de conditions météorologiques difficiles lors de la dernière journée de tournage, une scène importante n’a pu être tournée. L’argent amassé sera investi dans la complétion de cette dernière scène en studio, les touches finales sur la trame sonore et l’ajout de quelques effets spéciaux nécessaires. WHAT WE WOULD DO WITH 10 000$CE QUE NOUS FERIONS AVEC 10 000$The low water temperature on location were deemed to dangerous to shoot in so we had to cut them out of the script. With more money we could schedule another day of reshoot at an indoor pool!--La basse temperature de l'eau amenait un trop grand risque d'hypotermie pour les scènes sous l'eau donc la scène a été cancellée. En amassant 10 000$, nous pourrions la filmer dans une piscine intérieure!RELEASE / SORTIE DU FILMIt is our intention and goal to have it  premiere at Cannes.--Notre intention est de sortir le film en première à Cannes.LENGHT/DURÉEWe estimate the final cut to be around 12 minutes long.--La version finale du film durera approximativement 12 minutes.

Rocky Horror Saved My Life - A Fan Documentary|successful|"(VIDEO SLIGHTLY NSFW)“The Rocky Horror Picture Show” is the longest-running theatrical release in film history.  Since its debut in 1975, it has become the very definition of ""cult movie.""  However, if you’ve ever been to a live performance of Rocky Horror, you know that the film is only one part of a very unique midnight movie experience.  ""Rocky Horror Saved My Life"" is not a documentary about the people who made this legendary movie, though.  It's about the fans who have devoted their lives to preserving it.For almost 40 years, people from all walks of life have ""given themselves over to absolute pleasure"" by performing live on the stages, aisles, and seats of cinemas showing ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show.""  From the first time Louis Farese yelled ‘Buy an umbrella, you cheap bitch!’ in the audience at the Waverly in NYC, to the innovations that have brought Rocky Horror “audience participation” into the 21st Century, we'll examine the origins and traditions of this truly unique cinematic phenomenon from the perspective of the people who sacrificed so much to keep it alive.  Throughout 2014, our crew will travel to cities all over the US, and possibly all over the world, to document the history of Rocky Horror’s avid collectors, live performers, and devoted fans.Given our experience, and the resources at our disposal, we feel quite confident that we can make one hell of a documentary, even on a fairly tight budget.

FILM PROJECT:  A HISTORY OF COMING OUT|failed|The Pye Harris Project is a non-profit made from funds from the estates of Robert Harris and Ed Pye, life partners for over 60 years.  Upon Mr. Pye's death in 2012, funds he left in his will went into the creation of a series of films to teach young people about LGBT history through the stories of those who lived during different eras.  The first two films have been completed (Coming Out in the 1950s and Coming Out in the 1960s) and can be seen on YouTube.  The third and fourth films (Coming Out in the 1970s, and Coming Out in the Age of AIDS) are currently in production.We are looking for funds to edit the four short documentaries into one longer piece that can be offered to film festivals, schools and public television stations that gives a large broad overview of LGBT history.  The funds will be used to obtain additional archival footage, re-edit the existing films, and pay for publicity and future distribution.
No Man Is An Island|successful|"Why No Man is an Island?Stories like this come along once in a generation. And the story behind our proposed film is perhaps one of the greatest of the generation of our parents and grandparents who valiantly fought tyranny and oppression during the hard years of the Second World War in Greece.But ours isn't one of resistance, sabotage and bombs and bullets-- against the occupier. No Man is an Island is a story of soft power-- the victory of humanity over hatred; and, compassion over cruelty.Our short film will tell the story-- the survival story that is unique in all of Europe-- of the only Jewish community that didn't lose a single soul during the Holocaust. It is a story of heroism that needs to be told-- not only for future generations, but for the current one.International InterestThe project and the story of the Jews of Zakynthos have already generated international attention and media publicity in Greece, the United States, Canada, Mexico and beyond in major newspapers and media outlets. The story was even the topic of conversation between the Prime Ministers of Greece and Israel recently when the two met. We have also been featured in:Shalom Life, Canada's largest online Jewish publicationKathimerini, one of Greece's top daily newspapersMeet the TeamProducersFor producer Gregory Pappas, Zakynthos is personal. After hearing the survival story from his Cretan father as a teenager, Greg first uncovered testimony about Zakynthos while studying at the American College of Greece in Athens. He's dreamed of making a film ever since.In the last two years, Greg has produced two Cannes Short Film Corner films (Foreigner, Dichotomous), a feature-length personal documentary (Hello Anatolia), and a soon-to-be-released short starring Olympia Dukakis. With co-producer and DP Steven Priovolos, he recently circumnavigated the globe for a new TV series featuring adventure-seeker and kindness-champion Leon Logothetis.When he’s not producing films, Greg runs the Greek America Foundation, heads an event-planning firm called the Pappas Media Group, and writes for the Huffington Post. He also speaks regularly about Greece’s role during World War II, an era he has studied and researched extensively.We’re thrilled that No Man Is an Island has also attracted the support of the former president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Sid Ganis. As an Executive Producer, Ganis will lend advice and support on how to overcome the challenges of shooting a complex period film in a foreign country.Producers Gregory Pappas and Steven Priovolos, with Executive Producer Sid GanisDirectorRaised in Venezuela, director Joel Novoa is passionate about films that both entertain and convey a social-political message. Which is why NO MAN IS AN ISLAND felt like a perfect fit for Variety Magazine's rising Latin-American star.A recent graduate of the American Film Institute, Joel just completed his debut feature, “ESCLAVO DE DIOS” (“GOD’S SLAVE”), inspired by the 1994 bombing of the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association.Joel has worked on shorts and features in places like Venezuela, Argentina, Spain, Uruguay, Los Angeles, and Israel. His films have been recognized with selections and honors at more than 30 film festivals worldwide, including Cannes and the Los Angeles Shorts Fest.Director of Photography Award-winning cinematographer Steven Priovolos has signed on to shoot the film, in addition to his contribution as a producer. Born in Athens, Steven has worked on commercials, short films, and feature projects throughout the world, including the Greek features 180 Degrees and Kiss of Life. Have a closer look at Steven’s work here: http://www.stevendp.comScreenwriterAlready called a ""masterpiece"" by some of the top names in Hollywood who have read it, the script was penned by British screenwriter Mia Christou. Mia has worked professionally as a published author, writer, producer and actress.  Her background in theatre includes a Bachelor of Arts in Drama and English.  Recently, her feature script Lines in the Sand attracted the attention of Kennedy/Marshall and Sam Mendes, among others.Production DesignerTwo-time Art Director’s Guild nominee Giles Masters will be handling production design duties. Recognized for his art directing work in The Da Vinci Code, the Mummy franchise, and Tomorrow Never Dies, Giles brings over thirty years of experience to our short film.Concept art from another of Giles' WWII projectsSet PhotographerBorn in Tel Aviv, Roy Schweiger  is an accomplished fashion photographer whose work has been showcased in Milan, Cannes, and his home city. He has also served as an in house backstage photographer for DSQUARED2 since 2007.In addition to volunteering his time as a set photographer, Roy has painstakingly researched, located, and met with Greek Jewish survivors from Zakynthos.  His photographs speak to an eye for turning any location into his own stage.Jewish Zakynthos survivors located and photographed by Roy SchweigerLocation, Location, LocationThe true story behind No Man Is an Island played out on Zakynthos in the Ionian Sea. We plan to shoot some of the film on location in Zakynthos. In light of a 1953 earthquake that destroyed most of the World War II-era architecture on the island, we’ve identified the city of Chania in Crete as a primary stand-in for key Zakynthos exteriors. Since Greg's family is from Chania, our film will have plenty of local support.The 15th century synagogue of Etz Hayim on Crete matches period architecture on Zakynthos.BudgetOur budget is more than $165,000 to shoot the short film in Greece and ultimately submit it to festivals throughout the world. We have already raised half of this budget from major donors from a community of people around the world, like you! This Kickstarter campaign is designed to raise $25,000 and build a bigger army of support for this project.  In Conclusion!Our message is timeless.  No Man is an Island will share the largely unknown and untold story of how two men and 35,000 citizens of a Greek Island stood on the side of goodness and humanity when they stared evil in the face.No Man is an Island is a film that must be made. It is a story that must be told. With your help, this can become a reality.Remember-- your support is tax-deductible. The Greek America Foundation is a non-profit organization.We thank for your support and cannot wait to start shooting in 2014.Sincerely,Gregory Pappas & Steven Priovolos ProducersPS: We are also grateful for the support we've received from our friends for other projects.

Borders|failed|In collaboration with University of The West of England.MARE'S BEDROOM. NIGHT MARE, 30, is sitting on her bed, writing in her diary during the night. She leans back on her pillow,hesitates, and then scribbles vigorously with her pen. Little does she know that this will be the last entry shewrites, which will pass on through future generations: - Out there everything is full of borders; we are all travellers between the lines. The ones who draw the linesare the only ones who do not live between them.DIRECTOR’S CREATIVE STATEMENTOur project looks at migrants’ stories from a different perspective. Desperate people coming to Europe are demonised at worst and patronised at best. We want to switch the perspective, to show these ordinary peoplewho’ve lived through extraordinary circumstances as heroes instead of victims. This project is a tribute to all the ‘normal’ people who struggle to live a life with dignity; who fight to control their own destiny and don’t surrender to the manipulative games that these invisible authorities play when they manufacture emotions to control the dynamic of the world. They are my heroes, and I aim to portray them as such in this project.  The journey of our main characters, an eight-year-old girl, LLUITA and her father PARE, who flee the Middle East after her mother is murdered and the consequences of this journey and separation.The audience accompanies our characters on their difficult journey, witnessing the trials they face and sharing their fear and worry, before switching roles to suddenly become their attacker, heckling them from a theatre stage. Our experience of LLUITA and her father’s frightening journey reflects our experience of the many refugees seeking out a safe place to be: it’s easy to be sympathetic for people while they are at a safe distance from us, but once they reach our shores and threaten our cosy, comfortable lifestyles with their presence our attitude can quickly change. This scene challenges us and makes the audience reflect on our darker side. Jumping to the future, the film joins LLUITA as a woman in her 30s. Who has she become after this long journey from her hometown to cross the border into Europe? The same person on both sides of the line; the same person, and with the same enemies, just in different masks. The film aims to make audience reflect and question their own prejudices and open questions in their minds. Is it possible to escape a predestined fate?CREWMaria Tomas - Scriptwriter/Directorhttps://youtu.be/gxkSFIZi-5AMy passion for storytelling started when I was very young through the literature; writing poetry, theatre plays and narratives . Since then, I have always been looking for new creative ways to tell stories; that is what brought me in first instance to theatre as an actress, writer and director, collaborating with independent projects and working on my own productions, which as led to my further interest in the film world, writing, directing and editing my personal work in the University of West of England where I am currently studying Filmmaking.  Writing together with my interest in drawing and painting, makes media my favourite medium to combine and keep developing all my passions; keep learning, keep experimenting, always trying to go further in storytelling, because to me, no matter what medium of expression is used, it is about telling stories. Borders is my last year project at University which I have written, produced and directed. I believe, together with my talented team, Borders can become  a great short film with a remarkable story and a striking stylistic approach.Alex Waeland - Script EditorI have always enjoyed creative writing, and a good story, and since studying filmmaking at UWE Bristol, I have been developing my screenwriting skills and creative story-telling abilities to a more accomplished level. I have been applying these skills to my own work and offering advice to others too.I became interested in Borders when the story was pitched to me in its early development. Since then I have worked with the director and helped transform it into a well-researched and engaging script, which I am eager  to see transferred to the screen.Sergjes Bozoks - Director of PhotographyMy very first scar I got at the age of 5 because I tried to reach for a camera on a shelf to take a surprise photo of my family. That night ended in the hospital. Never the less, my passion for cameras and images did not go away. I have dedicated years of my life to explore and learn more about how light works and how with the help of different lenses and different cameras one can achieve desired emotional impact on the viewer. I have worked with the director, Maria Tomas, of the film on several projects. We like each other’s style of work and we have developed a short hand communication and understanding.  My Moto is: If film were all about the story I would quit image making now and move onto radio plays. There is enormous potential to enhance the story through visual means.Kahlen Chan - SoundI have finished my Associate Degree in Creative and Interactive Media at City University from 2012 to 2014. I am currently a degree student from University of West of England, Bristol, furthering my study in filmmaking and Creative Media. I specialised in sound.I keen on the sound edit work, so I choose sound as my specialism during my study and I will be the sound recordist and sound editor in this project. Sound work is one of the most important elements in creative industries, it is the easiest platform for creator to express their idea and engage their feeling to the audience. Georgina Freir - Production DesignerHi my names Georgina and I am the production designer for this project. I have a background in games development which I would say heavily influences how I go about my work. My inspirations are Eulyn C Womble and Katia St.           CASTZaida Alonso - LluitaZaida has performed in several short films, some of them internationally awarded.

Annulus: Ring of Light|failed|"What is Annulus: Ring of Light?A dream began in the fall of 2002. As he sat in his high school science class, Christopher Barry learned of a solar eclipse to happen in May 2012. Now, his longtime dream to witness this celestial phenomenon is coming to a head.Annulus: Ring of Light is a documentary/photobook of the journey he and photographer/videographer Erik Judson take from Anchorage, Alaska to Lunar Crater National Natural Monument in Nevada.Home to one of the darkest night skies in the country, the site has been described as so dark, ""the Milky Way casts a shadow,"" by one observer. Using this unique location, Erik will chronicle the  journey he and Christopher take to reach a partial (annular) eclipse on May 20. Afterwards, he will use the opportunity to take once-in-a-lifetime photographs of the night sky.A combined astrophotography/documentary project, Annulus will tell the story of this journey through video, time lapse, and photography throughout.What am I funding?This funding will allow me to purchase a full spectrum infrared/ultraviolet conversion for one of my cameras, a still/video dslr to shoot updates, and a wide-aperture lens for better astrophotography.What can I expect from the documentary?With a large array of cameras available to both the both of us, we will use a combination of digital, traditional (film-based), and time lapse photography.Combined with the real-time footage of interviews and our own interactions, the documentary will compile the time-lapse videos of our drive to and from the site, the solar eclipse, and the night sky for a couple nights following the eclipse.The documentary is expected to run approximately 45 minutes-1 hour. What about the photo book?With the sheer number of photos to be taken (approximately 10 rolls of film), multiple medium- and large-format photographs, and the digital cameras, I will select the best photographs I can find, and create a book from them.It will be hardcover and at least 30 photographs will be included.Who is involved in this project?Erik Judson is a Journalism and Public Communications Major at the University of Alaska Anchorage. With an emphasis in media production, he will work to tell the story of the eclipse in a visually appealing way.Christopher Barry is a Photography Major at the University of Alaska Anchorage. Specializing in film cameras of all kinds (35mm, medium format, and large format [4""x5""]), Chris will be attempting to create large scale prints for his own uses.REMEMBER: Kickstarter is an all-or-nothing fundraising source!

"CLICK HERE TO CHECKOUT YOUR SPECIFIC INDUSTRY IN OUR UPDATES SECTIONMaster Keys Pro (MKP) is a necessary innovation for any software for music production, DJing, game/graphic/web design, software programming, CAD, video editing, animation, gaming, simulators, data entry, basic home use and any other software by adults or children with any level of computer knowledge and skill. It brings huge advantages to any computer user in any industry or just at home. MKP is the most powerful multifunctional touch screen keyboard available. It has limitless functions for any music, gaming, creative, CAD, design software or home use on PC/Apple for right handed/left handed users. MKP replaces your standard keyboard/mouse with the MKP touch screen technology which allows you to work in new/more advanced ways and gives you a superior generation of computer interface. Although MKP keeps all of the current functions of a keyboard, it adds a huge amount of new options for you and it is far faster and easier to use for you every day in a more productive way. For those of you who use music, game/graphic/web design, CAD, video editing, animation, software programming, simulators and games software especially have many tool/menus on their screen and it obstructs your focus and workflow. With MKP you can arrange the tools/menus from your software on the MKP screen as you need them, using the existing layout of the software or by creating your own layout, while adding the option to use them by touch. This frees up space on the main screen as these tools are removed which gives you more free space to work in the same way a second upright screen would. The extra option to use gestures, as the MKP is a touch screen device, to zoom in/out of the tools gives you a more user friendly and productive interface.If you are one of those people who use music, game/graphic/web design, CAD, video editing, animation, software programming, simulators and games software especially have many keyboard shortcuts to memorize and use which burdens your mind as you have many other things to remember when working. With MKP you can create an unlimited number of your own templates with any feature/function for any software you need and design the layout on the screen however you want. Then you can save any keyboard shortcuts (Macros) as you want them set to a single button. This simplifies your workflow and experience so makes it faster and more creative. An unlimited amount of keyboard shortcuts can be set to an unlimited number of single buttons making accessing the tools with a single press very simple. MKP can show any layout of any set of tools from any software on the screen (using templates) at anytime you need them.For music production, game/graphic/web design, software programming, CAD, video editing, animation, gaming and simulators users there are so many dedicated keyboards on the market at the moment which are designed to be used with this software. Using several of them for several different bits of software fills the desk (congested table) and means you have to unplug one to plug in another when you change software. With MKP you get the option to switch templates in a split second which allows you to have instant access to any number of dedicated keyboard layouts by just loading the template needed for the software you are using without any rewiring/extra cost/time. Dedicated keyboards have a set layout and the user has no way to change this.With MKP the user can follow this standard layout or they can create a template which works better for them. The option to use several layouts saved as templates only adds to the flexibility of MKP and the advantages it offers to you as you work. For music users the problem is the same if not worse. The amount of MIDI controllers fills the desk and the cost of dedicated MIDI controllers adds up very quickly. With MKP you get the option to switch templates in a split second which allows instant access to any number of MIDI controllers without any rewiring/patching/spending required. You can also perform all the tasks of the music production process (recording/editing/mixing/mastering) without the cost of separate dedicated MIDI controllers for each process. You can use buttons/faders/twist knobs/basic keyboard shortcuts on the touch screen for any feature/function of the music production software including full control of VSTi/Plug-ins. MKP makes music software very quick/simple to use in a productive/creative way and is cost effective.Music users you get other advantages too besides switching the templates and access to any MIDI device. With MKP you get a powerful live tool which is equally powerful when used in a recording studio with any music production/DJ software, in the same way any other MIDI controller could be used but with the additional advantage of touch screen technology and the templates format. It may also duplicate the layout of your favorite MIDI controllers that exist already or will exist in the future. You can simplify your work by using the templates provided or creating your own. MKP can do the job of any number of MIDI controllers from the single device. The cost of purchasing separate devices to fill these requirements would be far more expensive and the space required in your studio adds up very quickly.MKP helps to reduce the cost of adding, updating and maintaining dedicated keyboards/devices or MIDI controllers as you can create or download new templates for any new requirements at any time you need to for FREE FOREVER. MKP is a touch screen device and as it is a screen/monitor it is backlit as any monitor would be. This brightness can be set to suit any situation you are in especially when you work or play games in a dark room or if you are a DJ playing music in a club. As with any monitor the MKP allows you to set the brightness of the display. This setting can be saved with the templates so each template can include the brightness setting for that individual template if needed. Additionally you can adjust the brightness at any time you need through the menus within our software or even set a keyboard shortcut button function for brightness within your templates.

We will include LEFT AND RIGHT HANDED VERSIONS of these where needed. We will include these templates simply to give you something to use right out of the box so you do not need to start making your own templates in the first minutes. These templates will be editable so allowing the users to customize them to meet any other/additional needs quickly and easily. There will be many more templates available on the website which are created by us and shared by other users and are ALL FOR FREE, FOREVER. Users will have all the tools they need to create their own templates for any software right out of the box. We have designed these tools to be as simple to use as possible to allow the users to take full advantage of the MKP and use it in any way they want. While our software is very simple to use to create anything the users will require it is also designed with developers in mind. The MKP SDK and API will also be included with the units at no extra cost so allowing developers to start working on their projects right out of the box. This means that everything you need for developing your own projects is provided allowing you to use the MKP in any way you require with no additional cost, downloading or installing required. We came up with this idea and did the research and development in 2010 but at that time the cost of touch screens for the mass production would not have offered a cost effective product to you (the users) so we put the project on hold and kept our eye on the prices of touch screens. We spent almost two years designing both the hardware and the software. We have been searching for the most ergonomic design for the hardware and for the best selection of functions for the software. We have partnered with a company in the US due to their reliability and quality. This company was selected as they specialize in and only makes touch screen hardware so they will perfect the product and the internal wiring while keeping the software within our own team of programmers. They have been guiding us and leading the hardware development side.Below are the designs for the units as they will be for the final productionUnit design - FRONTUnit design - SIDEUnit design - TOPBelow is a 3D render of the final unit design3D RENDERBelow are some photographs of the prototype Our prototype does NOT look like the final unit design as it is for screen and software testing ONLY!We have called this prototype the MKP-UD3MKP - Master Keys ProUD - Ugly Duckling (from the children's story about the ugly baby duckling that grew up to be a beautiful Swan)3 - Because this is the third prototype to datePrototype unit - FRONTPrototype unit - SIDEPrototype unit - TOPPLEASE NOTE – THESE PHOTOGRAPHS ARE THE PROTOTYPE ONLY!

To ensure that the quality of the hardware and the software reaches the maximum potential and user satisfaction we have already planned the best workflow from and the next new features and functions that will be added. We will entrust our partner in the US to do the mass production of the MKP as they are a very reliable partner with a rich production experience. The programmers are trusted to design the MKP software base on their variety of experience within music, graphic, gaming and other software. All funds put towards the MKP will be devoted to each workflow to ensure that the MKP project is a success. We now need your help to get MKP out into the market.Every single unit you buy from us helps us to change to a new generation of computing and to be productive in every field including graphic / web design, CAD, music, gaming, any simulators and also home use.Please help us reach our target of 4500 units worldwide and hit our first funding goal. there are 101 lower quality products out there but they ALL come with disadvantages when compared to the MKP. These products are simply inferior to the MKP and won’t offer you the same quality or results in your day to day use. 1)	There are companies out there who have similar ideas to us but they’re still far behind our product and results in every aspect because their research and development is very limited. Our understanding of the products requirement are far deeper due to our diverse team and their experience. Our research and development has included industry professionals in every area we intend the MKP to be used so we know our features, functions and design meet your requirement.2)	There are companies out there who are simply trying to duplicate our ideas but their quality, design, cost and specification aspects simply DO NOT MAKE SENSE AT ALL. Their limited screen size restricts the products ability to offer everything you require and in many cases the units are not ergonomically design. The price they offer is so cheap because they have limited features and functions and use low quality manufacturing. (see points 3&4)3)	Some companies are selling their products for less than 300 pounds which can only mean they are using low quality screens and plastic frames and low quality manufacturing. There is no way to get a high quality custom sized screen if the budget is so low and at such small order numbers. 4)	Most other products offer you far less features and functions so don’t bring you much of an advantage in your creativity and productivity. They have smaller screens so offering you far less space to work with touch and not offering you the full advantages of adding touch to your work. 5)	Many of them are battery powered with limited usage time and no direct USB power so you cannot use them for a full day of work and you cannot expect these products to last several years due to the general wear and tear and average life expectancy of batteries.6)	They have far less key presses per minute which will force you to slow down or not be able to perform some tasks at all and the higher latency will have an effect on your accuracy of work. This applies mainly in the music business but also applies to many other industries. 7)	These companies will expect you to pay extra for additional templates / layouts to use their product with other software which we will NEVER do as our website allows users to share templates freely with no restriction and our software is designed from the beginning to allow simple import / export of templates. 8)	Many of them are manufactured in places where we all know the quality is far lower than US manufacturing and several of them are running funding at amounts we already know will not cover a high quality screen due to our several years of research and development developing this product. We need to get the production volumes up in order to get the price down! It's as simple as that. With your help, we need to: Convert our prototype to the actual device ready for mass production Get all the appropriate regulatory approvals Deliver the fantastic products with even more capability to the backers To spread this smart invention to the whole world so everyone can use it for better productivity Taking functional prototypes all the way to quality retail products is a complex process that requires additional resources, both in capital and manpower. Now that we are at the point where we have proven our various technologies and demonstrated them in public, we have come to Kickstarter to help provide us with the assistance we need to become market-ready. ‘Great music, great graphic, great games and great designs come from great developers!’MKP is about a lot of things but first and foremost it is about the multifunctional touch screen keyboard/multi touch for anyone who does music, DJ, game/graphic/web design, animation, software programming, data entry, CAD,simulators, gaming or home use, Adults to Children, Beginners to Professionals. Many people do many different things at the same time, for example a sound designer also does graphic design work as his interest or a job so MKP helps him to perform his job easier and save device costs without reducing the quality of his chosen tools for working. Our campaign represents the new era in computing for all types of industries. We are giving the advantages to people who need them for any purpose. It is about a smart option to obtain productivity with the advantages given to the working environment such as creating a less cramped workspace on the screen, unlimited keyboard shortcuts to be set as unlimited templates, easy access to any dedicated keyboards & MIDI controllers, all-in-one music production, performing as a live tools or in a recording studio, a backlit monitor and cost saving for any adding, maintaining and upgrading of dedicated keyboards or MIDI controllers. Overall, we’re so far ahead from our competitors.It’s time to experience a far better way of computing. We’ve been working diligently for years. We managed to create our first working prototype and took time to perfect it. We are now fine tuning our design for mass production. We’ve put a great deal of effort into engineering a very simple and efficient design. We exhaustively tested our prototypes, documenting areas for improvement and systematically refining them. We are very confident in having a solid design. We’re a multi-disciplinary group with vast experience in all relevant music, graphic/web design, video editing and gaming fields. As part of our progress we have assessed all the challenges and risks which are part of making such a multi industry device. Some of the biggest risks are already behind us. We had to overcome a lot of challenges in order to get to where we are today. No one wants to see a good idea executed poorly. We’ve worked extremely hard to prepare this product for manufacturing and we’ve worked very hard to de-risk as much as we can before this campaign started. We’ve gone through the highly innovative design for manufacturing. As a result we’re nearly ready to begin manufacturing the first run of MKP.   We’ve learned a lot of lessons over the last 2 years and with your support we’re confident we can build a world class product with the MKP.  The challenges we’re facing now are the ones that are always part of the process of taking a working prototype into mass production. A large capital investment is required in MKP MAINLY for reliable mass production purposes which mean that we’ll deliver a great and high quality product with timely delivery to users. The good news is our USA based manufacturing partner believes strongly that Master Keys Pro is BETTER THAN the other similar devices and in our vision of making a versatile single device / keyboard for everyone. Our manufacturing partner will help us not only to achieve the best pricing and highest quality of production for the MKP but also to ensure stock and lead-times are within our production requirements. Our partner has set aside a large volume buffer of stock and factory time to cope with the initial demand from Kickstarter. All we need is the capital to execute this mass production. Our programmers are very responsible workaholics with deep creative development knowledge who work on this project alongside their daily tasks. We’ll continue to work hard on fine tuning the quality to ensure the best possible user experience. Our programming team also has a wide range of experience in the industries which we intend the MKP to be used in. This means they’re not simply designing the software blindly but that they clearly understand the needs of the users, of you and your work, and the results required by you. They have a lot of experience in delivering complicated projects on time within specifications and our development risk is reduced by having dependable programmers working alongside the first rate manufacturer. We’re prepared for future challenges which are ahead of us and we’re committed to keeping you informed of our progress in the following months. There are many challenges ahead in providing a product that is reliable and easy to use. That's why we've been building a crack team of the best programmers around to work on the MKP. We’ve learned a lot from our initial prototypes and we’re working hard to make MKP a future proof device that you’ll use every day. We pride ourselves on embracing innovative ideas and look forward to seeing MKP become a reality very soon. We’re very confident that we can deliver what we have proposed!

Boating with Clyde: Adventures on the Puget Sound|successful|"By now you have probably watched the introduction video for my dream show, Boating with Clyde. But that's just a small part of the project! Check it out!Combining the rich tradition of Fishing with John, Captain Puget, Pee-Wee's Playhouse and The Muppets, Boating with Clyde brings focus to the waterways of Puget Sound and the artists that dwell nearby. Boating with Clyde, a free internet-based program of video shorts, will feature Northwest and touring musicians and artists, performing and storytelling, while adrift on an 8-foot dinghy in the brackish waters.We'll explore the history and science of each area we float through, while learning from local artists where and how they draw inspiration from the waterways of the region. Boating with Clyde aims to launch its first season of production in the spring of 2011. Your help in funding the program would assist in paying the numerous production costs involved in producing this awesome adventure of a show!Boating with Clyde will strive to both educate and entertain adults and children, while building community through both artistic performances and interviews with local boat-builders, marine scientists, tug boat drivers and sea captains. The programs will vary in length from 10-20 minutes each, and be featured for free on my website.Http://www.boatingwithclyde.comThe show will also feature special puppets and animated segments.A fish puppet named Pinky BottomFeeder will give special underwater reports with his friend from Anacortes, Karl Blau.http://www.kelplunacy.com/To see other examples of my animation work, Look Here:Http://www.doitforthegirls.comYour support would cover the following expenses to make this super awesome: (Most of the expenses have to do with safety or filming underwater!!!)- 2 Hydrophones - underwater housing for a digital camera - a digital camera - additional life jackets - a larger motor - an extra marine battery (to avoid that stranded feeling) - 2 Lavalier mics - video tape and hard drives - rental of an underwater super 8 camera + film - underwater lights - wetsuitIf I reach my funding goal, I will go into production this Spring! If you break it down, it looks like this! If 300 people pledged 25$, this would happen. Holy cow! If 150 people pledged 50$, this would happen. WTF! OMG!I already built the boat with some help from friends over 6 years ago. Now I just need your help to go the extra (nautical) mile.(music for the theme song composed by the band Peace! for their song ""SummerTime"". Remixed with permission by Clyde Petersen)"
Beyond the Victory recording their debut EP|successful|We, at Beyond the Victory, are looking for the funds to give our dedicated fans exactly what we feel they deserve.  We're looking to add more to our family of friends. All donations recieved will help us record our first professional EP with the best quality possible for our fans ears. With this EP we hope to expand our BTV family and fans across the world with our music. Your generosity won't go unrewarded or unappreciated. We are asking for a little bit of help from you guys, so we can take our band to the next level and repay you guys back tenfold. We hope to put out the best music for you guys as possible. Help us reach our goal and you won't be dissapointed, we promise! Our challenge right now is facing the fact that we cannot raise enough money in time to be able to book the recording date.  We are recording all of the pre production tracks by ourselves and we are risking the fact that some tracks may not be good enough for the studio's standard.  After the project is funded we will get all of the backers what they wanted in the fastest time possible.  We are going to log all of the backers to ensure they get their rewards.
DayStay|failed|About UsMy experience as a long time Superhost on the Airbnb platform has provided my family the enjoyment of meeting wonderful people and an opportunity to generate additional income for monthly expenses.  I was inspired by the popular homeshare movement to create a new platform for those that are interested in sharing their homes for short term “day use” versus hosting overnight guests. Whether hosting in your primary residence, a second home or a rental, there is an opportunity to list your place on DayStay for a variety of gatherings AND generate extra income .DayStay users will find the Ideal space on the platform that will not only accommodate their events or meetings in a warm, private environment but they will also save money compared to the exuberant fees found at  most event venues. DayStay is ideally suited for gatherings of 20 people or less.  Some examples would be:Midday Business MeetingsBridal or Baby ShowersIn Home Retail PartieHosting a Children’s PartyDIY craft parties, etc. We are patent pending, Llc, and we are getting ready to submit our completed app to the mobile stores for review. We are planning a soft launch in the Bay Area of California once we are approved by the app stores. We are hoping the Kickstarter community can help us fund this 12 week launch.  Once we launch and have a significant amount of homeowners and guests completing successful stays, we will seek further investors to launch nationally later this year. Our project has come so far this past year.  Our product is fully developed, and the user friendliness is very comparable to the Airbnb site.  After hiring attorneys to get the proper waivers in place, the LLC, the patent, and the development, our marketing budget has been depleted.  We want to make sure our app has the best chance of success, s owe need people to sign up and use it!
THE LEAGUE OF HONOR|failed|THE STORYThe League of Honor is an action adventure based on a selected allegiance of regulators whose primary province is to ensure that justice prevails throughout the dimensions of time. The League of Honor represents integrity, bravery and loyalty. Individuals can only be admitted into The League of Honor when they have demonstrated principals of benevolence during their lifetime. They enter The League of Honor and are inducted only after they have saved, valued or placed another life before theirs and, unknowingly, risked their own life before thinking of the outcome. The League of Honor exists worldwide and throughout time. Members are called upon individually or as a complete unit when needed.WHY KICKSTARTER: The League of Honor is a project I began creating over 25 years ago. When the story was completed, I was well on my way with a graphic novel and a possible film. However, just as I was just about to introduce The League of Honor to the world, my mother, father and sister unexpectedly lost their lives. That unfortunate happening drained me in every way and to properly take care of them took all of my life savings. Climbing back up and just getting to the point where I was able to breathe again took every thing I had. I am finally ready to get this project back on track and I am setting my sights on the goals I had set for myself years before. The story of The League of Honor gave me the hope and strength I needed to survive. I am ready now to take this project where it needs to go and Kickstarter is the best way to help me get there.WHY YOUR HELP IS NEEDED: Your generous contributions would help to hire a team of artists to bring the world of The League of Honor to life and to create a series of graphic novels based on the characters. Your contributions would also help to create a small companion book and to obtain a booth at Comic-Con International to introduce The League of Honor on a larger scale. The funds will also help complete our website to further spread the message of hope that The League of Honor brings.Please visit http://www.theleagueofhonor.com for more information.
making more bringpacks|failed|Please support this project by helping us get enough pledges to meet the goal. We can't make more bringpacks unless the goal is met. Stay connected through Kickstarter and Facebook for developments in the bringpack designs as we get feedback from supporters.You can pre-order your bringpacks by clicking a pledge amount. Kickstarter works as a source of crowd funding by charging supporters their pledge amount only if the goal is met. After the funding deadline, there will be a survey for all the supporters to get information to finalize their orders and get shipping information.What is a bringpack?Bringpacks are pop-up backpack baskets and can carry many bulky items while leaving your hands and arms free. Bringpacks are made of polyester and steel, so they will not mildew or rot.Why are bringpacks special?Many features set bringpacks apart from all other utility carriers. Most notably, bringpacks fold up and tuck into themselves for storage. Plus they offer all the conveniences of a standup basket. And they are very comfortable on the back unless there are poky objects.Additionally, bulky loads can now be carried on the back, which greatly reduces back strain and the likelihood of tripping. Parents, students, and kids of all ages have found so many uses for bringpacks that it may be impossible to make one design that satisfies everyone completely.How is your bringpack going to look when you get it?We are actually happy to say that this product is in the design revision stage with our manufacturer. This means that there are design decisions still left to be made. Color, strength/weight, and overall size will be decided by popular vote of all backers. We need to meet the manufacturer's minimum order for individual styles, but we may be able to do different colors as part of the minimum order.Why are bringpacks on Kickstarter?I got a country music song life right now and I can't make bringpacks inexpensively enough myself. Kickstarter appears to be the best bet for getting the kind of feedback we need to make bringpacks truly awesome and raise the capital for the initial production run.Why a goal of $15,000?$7,000 for minimum order of bringpacks (5,000qty)$2,000 Overseas freight$4,000 Domestic shipping of rewards to backers$200 Quality/Rework/Handling$1,800  fees and taxesStretch Goal: $20,000 Get your photo on a bringpack!

Projecteo: The tiny Instagram projector.|successful|Projecteo press coverageProjecteo is a tiny Instagram projector. It uses wheels of 35mm slide film you make online and each one holds nine photos. Whether they're of your best friends, that holiday last summer or good old pictures of cats, just pop them into Projecteo, focus by twisting the lens barrel and sit back to enjoy your slideshow.We've developed a process to get your Instagrams onto a single frame of 35mm Kodak film stock, which is cut into a circle and fits snugly inside a wheel.  To change wheels, just gently pull it out and place the next one in the slot. You will be able to collect as many wheels as you like.No pixels, no pixelation.Like all projectors, Projecteo works best in the dark. We've had great looking images up to two and a half feet wide in a pitch black room. Unlike screens, slide film doesn't have pixels. This means you get beautiful looking images from a device the size of a matchbox.The functioning prototypeSLS printed prototypeWe started off by 3D printing early prototypes of Projecteo. Sure, it was rough and stuck together with tape but it had enough charm to make us fall in love with the idea. We wanted to see how far we could take it.Through an iterative process, we optimised the focal length of the lenses and added a focusing mechanism. We looked for the most powerful LEDs we could find, made the batteries replaceable and figured out the perfect ratio of images per wheel. We modified the outside edges to give Projecteo a five degree chamfer, to make it a bit nicer to hold. Oh and of course, we gave it cute little feet.Though we had a prototype that did everything we wanted Projecteo to do, we were not ready for manufacturing. To take us through to that next step, we started working with Meso, a product development consultancy in Scotland. With their help and guidance, we made a production prototype.We now had a model with parts designed to be injection moulded and all components custom made to fit right in the case. The surface finishes are high gloss on top with a textured matte grey bottom. We now also had a production prototype circuit board, the miniaturised version of the electronics we would be able to make at scale. As a final touch, we made the button a bright, fire truck red. Buttons you want to press are always red.With a working production prototype, the beginnings of tooling and the first sample ready to be injection moulded, the hardware was coming together nicely. But we also had to figure out how you pick your images online. Luckily, we know a thing or two about that.How do you pick your images?Mint Digital is an agency and product development company. We collaborate with startups to large companies to make digital products. We also invent, build and run our own ventures like Foldable.me and Stickygram, giving us quite a bit of an experience in connecting to Instagram and turning digital pixels into physical stuff. We've also learned a lot about fulfilment and shipping to the world.We've already been hard at work on the web component of Projecteo and will continue to polish the experience. For now, here's a sneak peek.How do your pictures become slide film?Our developers in the US use a similar technique to how Hollywood convert digital movies to 35mm film to project in cinemas. Your Instagrams are 'melted' on to a single frame of Kodak film, which is then processed in a similar way to how analogue films are developed, except in full colour.From the development trays, we cut out individual sets using our custom circle cutter. We then place each unique piece into one of our wheels.Screws, not glueProjecteo has been designed so you can disassemble it.  This will not only make them easier to recycle but it means you can pull it open and see what's going on inside. There, you will find a super bright LED, capacitors and resistors, a switch, a decade counter and three batteries. Feel free to hack away! We can't wait to see your creations.Where will it be made?The components will be sourced and injection moulded in China. The factory we are working with is in Guangdong city and adheres to all labour condition laws. It's run by a nice gentleman called Henry, who looks after his staff well. Assembly of Projecteo and the development of images will happen in upstate New York, at a professional photography lab run by a lovely man called Neil. He will take care of printing your Instagrams and popping them into wheels.When will you have Projecteo?With successful funding, we will be able to make Projecteo between mid-December and mid-January. After manufacturing, units will be drop tested to the American standard and EU/FCC certified, which should take a maximum of two weeks. We'll then need to test our fulfilment process to make sure the Instagrams you choose on the site are matched with the physical wheels.Once we have everything running smoothly, we should be able to roll out units to our first Kickstarter backers around late February. We will ship units in the order we receive the pledges, so back early to get Projecteo early!Something special for Kickstarter…The whole idea behind Projecteo came about when Ben found a Rollei film projector and a bunch of slides on a market stall. He fell in love with the beautiful and refined design of the projector and set about to find a way of getting his Instagrams onto slide film.In homage, we'd like to make 1000 limited edition Projecteos in the Rollei P35 colours. We will only ever make these available on Kickstarter.Special Kickstarter editionIt's been a long and difficult but fascinating journey so far, and we can't wait to get Projecteo into your hands. However, there are still a few bumps along the way and we need your help to get us there.Thanks for taking a peek.Projecteo is a project by Mint Digital. With thanks to Meso Design.There are inherent risks and challenges when developing any sort of product, be it physical or digital. When we mix the two, it gets slightly more complex. We've got a great team working on Projecteo with the right skills and experience to finish the job. Here is what we face in the upcoming months.1. Financial backingWithout your support, we can't cover the cost of tooling and get a handle on the minimum order quantity we should commit to for the first batch. We need your help to get us there.2. Refining the toolWe have made a pretty good start on this and produced some first samples. To get the tooling to the standard we require at volume will take more time, money and effort.3. FulfilmentThough we have our circle cutter, we will need to install it in the photography studio and look to set up an efficient and accurate fulfilment procedure to produce wheels at scale for Projecteo.4. WebThis part of the project is well underway. Making digital products is something we have the expertise in, but there are still tricky problems to solve. We'll keep working at it until we get the experience of creating your wheel just right.5. RolloutOnce we reach our funding goal, we'll need to send Projecteos to all our backers. This will involve shipping from China, assembly in the US, developing each individual film and wheel, boxing them up and sending them across the world. We have experience in this from our previous ventures, but Projecteo is just that much more complex. We are looking to trickle units out in increasing volumes to test all our processes as we go and iron out any kinks as early as we can. With your support, we can tackle anything that comes our way and get Projecteo out in to the world.Thanks for checking out our project and have an awesome day.Ben and the Mint Digital team.
Digital Aristocracy: A Commoner's Guide to Digital Riches|failed| Welcome to the Digital AgeWhere technology is king and those that create it become noble.Digital Aristocracy is the fruition of years of study at various universities and looking at both past and present trends in economic history. This book will profile some of the current members of the Aristocracy and their climb to nobility.  It will include my own personal journey/creation of a digital manor with www.vuzama.com. The book will also highlight the road for others to follow should they dare to acquire digital riches.Why raise money on Kickstarter? Build an audience (I want to know that people are interested)Establish a pre-order market for my bookTo self-publish the book ensuring that my creative influence is unalteredPeople to hold me accountable to finish on timeWhat the funds will provide:The book. Plain and simple, I need money for all the research that will go into the book. So far this endeavor has cost a tidy little sum. More than I originally thought I needed. Additional funds will allow me to complete the project and get it to print. This includes more research, artwork and publishing costs.What I provide in return:The use of goods in appreciation is a time tested model. Furthermore, I feel that there is no better way to say thank you than your name being printed in the book and a keepsake so you can always remember. Digital Aristocracy in the news & internet:http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/02/15/president-obama-courts-silicon-valley-s-new-digital-aristocracy.html http://laurenoutloud.com/main/index.php/tag/mark-zuckerberg/ http://sacrebleuwine.tumblr.com/post/460989245/probably-the-most-insightful-and-profound-comments http://googleexposed.wordpress.com/2012/02/24/google-has-too-much-influence-in-washington-and-abroad/ http://www.joelkotkin.com/content/00556-new-class-warfare Here is a blurb from the book:                Afterreading various news articles and books I began to see a trend occurring. Thistrend could easily be called the rise of the Digital Gentry. Thisclassification was a combination of both the technological age and the social classthat it represented. The first occurrence of this Digital Gentrificationoccurred during the “dot.com” explosion as multi-millionaires were created overnight and a class of individuals rose out of that, the DigitalAristocracy.  Today the Digital Aristocracy lives a privileged life of jetsetting and leisure. For all of those interested in joining the DigitalNobility, they must start on the path as part of the Digital Gentry. They mustbuild their Digital Manors, hire Digital Knights and set forth into the DigitalLandscape for fame & fortune, and let this be your guide to Digital Riches. I hope you enjoyed it so far, and please support the Digital Aristocracy: A Commoner's Guide to Digital Riches. Daniel R.

It's Time to Move On|failed|"In closing, THANK YOU!As we close out our funding, a HUGE thank you to all of our backers!  You are the reason this project is possible, and we appreciate your support.  If you missed your chance to participate in the Kickstarter campaign, you can still get your own pair of Broeks over at www.goforbroek.com.  And you can stay in the loop by Liking our Facebook page (www.facebook.com/goforbroek), or by Following us on Twitter (www.twitter.com/goforbroek).Please continue to spread the word, and we look forward to producing and delivering your first pair(s) of Broeks!Jay and ChrisIt ain't Broek, so we intend to fix it.Why Broek, why now?There are literally hundreds of men's brands to choose from, but how do you know what to buy?  Do you choose based on budget?  By brand?  By cut?  By fit? By look?  Is the quality of the denim relational to the amount of money you're spending?  How much are you really paying just paying for name?  Aren't most of the top manufacturers using similar denim?  Is selvage denim really that much better?  Is heavier denim more durable, but less comfortable than a lighter weight denim?  What makes a pair of jeans comfortable anyway?  How much of it is cut?  How much of it is fabric?At Broek, we think that the last thing the world needs is another straight legged, conformist pair of men's jeans.  The time is right to move on, to try something new and different.Changing the way you view bottomsIt all started with a desire to come up with a better fitting jean, but along the way we noticed something.  What would you wear when jeans weren't really appropriate, or you just wanted something different?  Dress pants?  No, 5 days a week at the office was enough.  Chinos?  No way, most shoelaces have more style then chinos.  Cargo pants?  Really?  So, what was there then?  There really wasn't a viable alternative.Born out of this void between jeans and pants, we found an opportunity, a hole that desperately needed to be filled.  With this new mission we set off to create something new, but yet familiar.  It feels like your old, favorite pair of jeans, but with the look of an awesome pair of pants.We give you the fruit of our labor, we give you our Broek bottoms.Introducing Broek bottomsSome of the available colors to choose from.Broek's proprietary wedge cut bottom let you have the style of a longer cut without all that pesky fraying.Of course your Broeks will have a chain stitched waste band.It's not a coin pocket, it's a phone pocket!

We’ve teamed up with a production house in downtown Los Angeles, who have done sample and development work for Joes Jeans, J Brand, Paper Denim and Cloth, Guess, and Resin, just to name a few. Not only do they have the most talented sewers we’ve ever seen, they are also the most expensive development house in Los Angeles, and have a year long waiting period for new clients. We’re using reinforced overlock stitching throughout the entire pant, we’ve put hidden bar tacks in all of the high stress areas, and seen to all the little things that make a pant durable for the long haul.  This includes  unbroken chain stitched waistbands, and heavy duty reinforced cotton for all the liners. Bentley and pants just had a baby, and it’s our Broek bottoms.SizingYour Broeks will be available in waist sizes 28"" through 38"".  Inseam sizes will be available in the industry standard Short, Regular, and Long (30"", 32"", 34"" for waist sizes 28"" through 34"", and 32"", 34"", 36"" for waist sizes 36"" and 38"").  For all of the specific measurements, check out our sizing / fit chart below.Sizing / Fit Chart (subject to slight variations as we head into production):Tailor TemplateWe love our wedge cut bottoms, and we know you will too, but what happens when you don't fit into the normal available lengths?  Great question!  Every pair of Broeks will ship with a ""Tailor Template"", which will provide your tailor with the leg bottom pattern.  This eliminates any guess work on their part, and should result in a perfect fit.Going for Broek together!At Broek we want to involve you in the process.  We have set a funding goal of $25K, which will allow us to complete a first run of our new Broek bottoms.  We've also set a stretch goal of $40K, which will allow us to expand the run to include additional colors and washes (which you will help us decide).We can't do this alone, we need your support!  We hope that you will find a reward level that suits you.  Your purchase will not only help us execute our project, but you get to be one of the first people on the planet to discover what it is like to strap on a pair of newly minted Broeks.Can't contribute financially?  No problem!  You can give us a big boost by simply giving us a ""Like"" on Facebook (goforbroek), following us on Twitter (@goforbroek), and telling your friends what we are up to.Every little bit helps!Also, at the conclusion of our Kickstarter project you can keep up with where we go from here by checking out www.goforbroek.com.  Can you say Broeks for women?As with any project there are risks, and a fashion project is no different.  We feel confident in our ability to deliver, based on years of experience executing highly complex projects on time and on schedule.  We have established relationships with industry players, who make it their business to keep the major brands happy and coming back for more.  Of course, we are certain to hit a bump or two in the road, and we stand ready to navigate them without negatively impacting you, our backers, from getting your hands on your very own pair of Broeks."
Lazy Glamour: Eco-Underwear - soft, sustainable, and US-made|failed|Lazy Glamour's missionis to:Create chic, comfortable everyday underwear for every woman that is:Made with sustainability in mind, and Made in the US – in fact all manufacturing and sourcing is done within CaliforniaOur undies include bikinis, thongs, and boyshorts in different colors, with different screen-printed designs.Boyshort with Chrysanthemum printThong with Hummingbird printBikini with Lips printBoyshort with Poppy printColors: We plan to offer both white and black panties, with 1-2 additional colors (to be determined).Prints: We will offer our signature Lip print, Chrysanthemum print, Poppy print, Hummingbird print, and 1-2 additional prints (to be determined).We have tested our underwear in small markets, and refined our fit and sizing. Now we need your help to expand our reach to approach distributors and retailers, as well as build our online store. If we make our Stretch Goal we can finally expand our sizing to include plus size women.  Lazy Glamour Kickstarter TimelineKickstarter Goal = $20,000 (stretch goal is $28,000), so where does it all go?$4,000 for design and development of a professional e-commerce website $2,500 for photographer, models and updated product images $3,000 for marketing campaigns to distributors and retailers $1,500 for grassroots PR campaign to build awareness for new website $700 for production samples $6,000 for fabric and manufacturing $1,500 for dyeing, silk screening designs and packaging (all eco-friendly of course!) $800 for shipping rewards $1,000 for Kickstarter feeStretch goal: $1,000 for patterns and samples for plus sizesStretch goal: $1,000 for photographer, models and product images Stretch goal: $1,500 for marketing to plus-size retailers and distributorsStretch goal: $3,600 for fabric, manufacturing and dyeingStretch goal: $500 for shipping rewards and packaging (all eco-friendly of course!) $400 for kickstarter feeDelays are always a possibility with manufacturing. In the first 2 years of building Lazy Glamour, we've experienced them all - having to change manufacturers, finding a new fabric weaver, dealing with a problem with fit or sizing in samples, trim being discontinued, changing screen printers due to poor environmental practices - but we have learned how to be proactive and rebound. We have a terrific team of contractors to help create our undies, but if something happens and we have to shift course, we will. We'll be sure to give you a heads up as soon as we know, and keep you updated as we find alternative solutions.
Saber Design Apparel|failed|My name is Jonathan Marrs. I started Saber Design Apparel with one goal in mind, and that was to design shirts that reflected my passion for creativity. To get a sense of the style and design language, you can visit https://saber-design.myshopify.com where you can view the initial product line of 17 original shirts and learn more about the company. Every design is fully completed and ready to be printed using direct-to-garment printing once an order is placed.My workstationTo expand the design library and grow the brand, I am raising funds to create more designs and polish the website. Every Saber Design product is created from the ground up and includes designing, production, and finally an addition to the product line. Through Kickstarter, I plan to create 10+ new designs for the existing product line and also create designs for women's apparel. It took me months to finalize the initial shirts for 2017, but I am ready to work harder than ever before to push out more quality shirts than ever before. In addition to funding, this project will also serve as a motivator to create better designs for the brand.The process of expanding the brand Always looking to the future I am making more designs and working on Saber Design Apparel to make the brand the best it can be. I am not working on any other projects; this is my only project, all of my personality and energy are funneled into my brand.
Capturing the Soul of a Town|failed|I have taken a big dive off the deep end to pursue my passion - to tell the story of Fairfield Iowa, one of the most talked-about small towns in America. And I have to tell you -  it feels fantastic.  I've dropped everything to produce the Fairfield History Series and leave a lasting legacy for our children and everyone who wants to learn about this unique small town. I love Fairfield and I want to help people connect to this special place on our planet in a way that touches their hearts. If you look at our lives today, what we are doing today, working, eating, living... we're all so busy. This project is about gaining a new perspective so we can live a more fulfilled life today by experiencing and learning from the stories of the people who lived before us.With help from over 75 local volunteers, we are producing the Fairfield History Series, a documentary series of eight films which beautifully depict the fascinating history of Fairfield Iowa and Jefferson County. We just completed our first film “Life Before Fairfield” and we are thrilled at the response. It’s about the prehistory of this area - from the Pangea shift and how our lands were formed to getting to know the native tribes that lived here for thousands of years ago on the land we now call home. Landscape artist John Preston with drone camera overheadWe have just begun filming our second chapter in the series called “Heroes of Fairfield” about six ordinary people or groups of people who did extraordinary things for our town and our world. It includes local members of the Underground Railroad and a local Civil War heroine that almost nobody knows about today, yet some believe she saved hundreds of soldiers' lives. In between these stories, we will deliver our history in a way we hope unites and inspires the people who see it.We have filmed over twenty full-length interviews so far as well as over fifty short interviews plus hours of aerial shots of Jefferson County to be used in future films. But we have so much more to do, That includes a tremendous amount of historical research to insure accuracy. We are making sure to interview some of our older citizens right away while their memories are still vivid. Yeah, it's a little crazy as we are filming for all of the films all of the time. Quite an undertaking. But we have some amazing advisors including advisors and students from the David Lynch Masters in Film Program at our local university.Here is where you come in. • Make a Pledge - if you like our project and can help out, thank you.• Tell your friends - if you like this project, just let them know!• Watch our filmTotal budget for each film going forward is $60,000. We have seven films left to produce. So $10,000 gives us a big start for our second film.  It’s important to me to properly pay our artists and musicians as well as our editors who work so hard to help finish our films.  Tentative titles of the seven future films in the series: Heroes of Fairfield Agriculture Heritage and the Future of Local FarmingFairfield Firsts and Economic Development iFairfieldParsons College - a 100 year old educational traditionMaharishi International University (now MUM) - when Maharishi Mahesh Yogi came to town Culture - Artists and Musicians - their Impact on our community The Future of Fairfield - a new generation takes overOne risk for this project is if something happened to me. I am the driving force behind it. I am a very big guy, I'm 61 years old and people might think my health is at risk. But I'm a deeply happy man and I'm not going anywhere. I am here on Earth to do this job and I will complete it. The second risk is lack of funding. That's where you come in. I know there is someone out there who will see the value in this project not only for Fairfield, but as a model for many other small communities around the world. Just so you know, Fair Field Productions is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization. My challenge is to keep this very reasonable budget down while making sure to honor our local artists and musicians who contribute so much to these films. They are so talented and giving. Thank you.

Based on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes, based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal or Stripe. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more promo goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the EU (European backers), UK (UK backers), Asia (Asian backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic pledge, with 1 or 3 games and their related promos. Estimates for 2 games will fall in the price range between the 1-3 estimates. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address and that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose. >>> Note that, in compliance to the EU and UK laws, VAT will also be charged on the pledge manager system for EU and UK backers. At this time we cannot estimate the cost as the charges vary from country to country and it is based on the price of the order plus the actual shipping costs (which can only be properly determined in the system). However, the VAT charges will be fully disclosed on the system to be examined. European countries that are not part of the European Union or UK will not be charged VAT.**Brazil, Africa, and Middle East estimates are based on USPS rates. If USPS is not available, these rates may change.Unfortunately, different import laws, customs, and contractual obligations prevents CMON from shipping to certain specific countries or regions.THIS PROJECT WILL NOT BE SHIPPED TO: Latin American countries (with the exception of Brazil), Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan. Be aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a ""Late Confirm"" and will be shipped from the Asia Hub at a later date, likely incuring increased shipping costs and possible customs fees. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, the content offered on Kickstarter. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.The table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.To learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.This is our 46th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as:Production delaysShipping delaysCustoms delaysThe estimated delivery date for this project is November 2021, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.  We've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. REFUND POLICYWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign’s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that’s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can’t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we’ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.All refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.This project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.TERMS AND CONDITIONSBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.If you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.If you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.All backers that have selected “No Reward” on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All “No Reward” pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.If you do not accept these terms please do not pledge on this project, but instead wait for the retail release.To make sure you have the best gaming experience, all CMON products are warrantied against manufacturing defects for 2 years from the of date purchase from CMON (proof of purchase required).

The items could be small toys, tasty treats, postcards with images, a piece of music or a video, or a quote, story or poem.

Cyberines #1|successful|"If we hit $3000 I am giving everyone a free Cyberine trading card. YES! Even you $4 digital guys! Everyone who pledges over $4 will get this awesome reward! Also, Everyone who backs this project will get their name on the backer's page in Cyberines #1. Everyone!Cyberine, the USCC and Shadowflame.Cyberines #1 takes us to the next step of human evolution.  We delve into the past of what turned one of the Cyberines into a deadly enemy. Was he always destined to be? We also introduce a new ""Villain"". The Persian freedom fighter Sirocco. Is he friend, or the worst type of foe?The story, is a simple one. When I was 14 years old I created my Captain America mixed with The Six Million Dollar Man hero, Cyberine. That is 1985 to you young pups. In Bergen Tech Print Shop, Mr. Pavlu tasked us with creating a flyer for something that interested us. Me being a huge comic fan and also had just read Captain America with Deathlok, I created a character to be in that vein. I was also very patriotic as a teen. I still am. Cyberine made his first appearance alongside Agent Napalm in Shadowflame #2(1996/2007) to arrest Billy Barnes, also knows as KillWatt the Electrocutioner. He was hired by Don Tony Baltinetti to kill Shadowflame for disrespecting his nephew Tommy. The Cyberines, or United States Cyberine Corps made their first full appearance in Shadowflame #4(1997/2007) where they helped Shadowflame fight and defeat Maldestrak. Cyberine was in a tragic accident that required the government to make him better, stronger and faster. The cost was a helluva lot more than $6 million dollars.The Cyberines follows a ""family"" of Cybernetic Marines. They are the top tier of elite combat class of soldier: the USCC, the United States Cyberine Corps. Their members are recruited and trained at a young age and then cybernetically or genetically enhanced. This can be due to an accident or injury that has occurred in the line of duty or just to unlock their genetic potential.Cyberines #1 cover by Cory Hamscher and Sean ForneyJoe, Jeff and Sean's cover.The Cyberines first appeared in the Shadowflame mini-series from 1996.I no longer have the first Cyberine drawing that I did. But this is from 1986!Special thanks to the creative team, Cory Hamscher, Pow Rodrix, Sean Forney, Ed Dukeshire DW from Fanboysinc and R.J. Michaels. The book is 99% done. It needs to be lettered and printed. This will mean that the book will be in your hands soon after the Kickstarter is over."
Poems For Apostates & tales of a young Scientologist|failed|"The Church of Scientology is notorious for harassing members who leave and especially to those who publicly speak of their experience.  Good or bad is of no value. Part of the reason for this is simple self preservation.  Its written into the doctrine that all good scientologists must apply the ""fair game"" policies to people who are labeled ""suppressive persons"".  The only thing one has to do to earn this title is leave. They have stood in front of every project I've tried to get off the ground. They still do. Starting over from scratch at 27 years old and losing my career and every person I knew was a process that I experienced alone. It led to an addiction to pain medication which actually was easier to deal with than the loneliness and abandonment I faced.  Eventually I overcame that and much more. I consider myself a surviver and am still meeting those challenges today but finally with the fortitude of knowing who I am and wanting to share that. I know self publishing is the safest route considering the fact that Scientology doesn't want my voice heard.It will happenIt already hasI've gained momentumfrom the bad intentionsof all your bitchingI didn't want this-but its your systemOr rather a religionthat doesn't welcomeindividual thoughtThe artists I knewwho acted like thatgot made examples ofAnd the high pressuresalesman tactics don'tdo you any favorsWhich makes youpander mostly topaper chasersStill trying to figureout what money'sgot to do spiritualityI definitely don't buythat mentalityAnd I won't let gountil you learnsome humilityAnd respect for every humanAllowing everyone thesame rights to existYou don't decidewho is subhumanand who isn'tYou are not divineMy life is mineand you don't define meI am finally still Knowing I was builtfor thisHeart and handsin tandemWords come infor a landingWith reckless abandonI'm stillstanding."
