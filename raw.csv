Where is Hank?|failed|AFEW THINGS ABOUT MEAtage thirteen I made my first movie, a short cartoon. And I got a kickout of it! At age nineteen I wrote my first feature script. Andshoved it into the drawer. At age twenty one I wrote twelve shortscripts, and shoved them into the drawer.  At age thirty one I wrotea script and found the agent. He shoved it into the drawer. At ageforty three I wrote the script and sent it to Hollywood. You guessedit, they shoved it into the drawer. Well, that really ticked me off.So, I wrote another script and made a movie. Finally!Favoritecolor: transparentFavoritefood: foodPoliticalorientation: hardened optimistOK,so much for formalities, now back to the movie.Where is Hank?The StoryOfficer Jack pulls into abandoned property. He walks straight towards the dead body concealed by the dense vegetation. Not noticing it, he turns back and leaves.Karen is uneasy. She's been looking for her landlord Hank, and instead she had found her ex-boyfriend from Chicago, whom she broke up with two years ago. Weird enough, they bumped into each other at the abandoned property. Two teenagers, Aaron and Kyle are also fond of the place. Torn up and abandoned, it's the perfect sanctuary, a spiritual hangout that will shake them to the bone. But for now their thrill is only to get stoned. Something is not right there. A lot of people would stop by, but not for long. Suddenly they would get restless and leave. There is something forbidding and eerie about it. The rumor has it, it's the place where Hank's twin brother Earl has lost his marbles.HOWTHIS MOVIE CAME TO BEFebruaryof 2007 I moved to Tucson. Both studios I worked for went bankruptwithin a month. Guess it was a sign. I picked a rental on the edge oftown. Film making was now only a distant past. In Chicago I worked onIndy projects, knew people and could call in favors. And in Tucson?Oh well, you win some and then lose even more. Or so I thought.THESETAsluck would have it, I lived right by the abandoned property. It was atrashed out shack with a lot of stuff baking in the sun. And itlooked weird. Like people had just left, leaving everything behind -some ten years ago. Then it dawned on me. It's a perfect setup for astory! A murder mystery! Adead body found at the abandoned property! It's an exterior - therewas no need for lighting or extra grips! Beautiful!Ifinished the story in a week and the script a month later.  Needless tosay, it had to be a comedy. Great! I can make the movie now!CASTAND CREWWell,not so fast Bubba! I was new to Tucson. How am I gonna find the goodtalent and the crew? At this point, I have to share a peculiar thingwith you. Every time I hit a wall with a project, and in desperation,utter words like “How on Earth am I gonna do that?”, things wouldjust happen. No joke, every time.So,a few days later, I unloaded my grief to Kevin (Patrick), the guy Iknew from the water store. “You know, I had been in a couple of lowbudget productions here in Tucson” he said. So we started talking.And I learned not only did he work in front of the camera but alsoknew the nuts and bolts of a rolling production. It was a Godsend!Inone stroke, I got the co-producer, casting director and the policeofficer character. Kevin did one casting call and all the characterscoasted in.Iplanned to use my old SD cam, but now, it just won’t cut it. Thetalent was too good to be wasted by a low quality image. So my piggybank succumbed to the unfortunate encounter with the hammer, and therest I borrowed (thanks Julius) and bought a new HD camera and a fewother things to make the shoot easier.Appropriately,the production company was named Flat Broke Pictures.THECAN THING...$30Kand twenty seven days later, the movie was in the can. I have tothank the crew and the cast - they were exceptional. There is asilver lining in this project. Every time we would finish a scene ortwo, the results were way beyond expectation. Casein point #1; I was hoping for an average cast and ended up withactors better than seasoned talent. Every one of them. Casein point #2; we were praying for a decent audio (the Achilles heal ofcountless indie movies) and even the pros commented on how clean theaudio was (thanks Kenny). Casein point #3; after reviewing the footage in open color IO (created bySony for big budget films) I found that it also has a pristine 35mmquality, with huge latitude and is ideal for compositing and keying.And that's a must..… ANDAFTER THE CANWell,I started tinkering with post-production during the shoot, butresults were frustrating. Editing, I am at home with, but propercolor correction? On 2K footage? Creating good particle CG? And don'teven get me started on sound design and the score... I tried variouslow end solutions, spent another $7K on equipment and after a year,finally realized that it will not suffice. High end post-productionis a very expensive, tedious and time consuming job when done right.LIGHTAT THE END OF THE TUNNELIna nutshell, it was depressing.Andthen one day, after uttering that quintessential line, “ And how onEarth am I suppose to do that?” I got a phone call from Tina(Gabrielle character). So, like any nice guy, I unloaded my griefonto her and she said “Why don't you try Kickstarter?”Kickstarter? What is that? I had no idea. I heard about it on NPRbut, I had no clue to what it was. And then I learned about crowdsourcing and realized it was the best chance I have to finish themovie the way I want it. Go straight to the audience and tell them -”Hey, this is the movie I want to make but I'm stuck! I need help!If you like the idea please pitch in”.So,there you have it. It took a while but, I had to break it down. Ineed your help. I would like to make this movie as good as possible. Foryears I worked on other productions, honing my craft, but I couldnever call them my own.  This movie has evolved in both quality andscope, way beyond my initial expectations. The way I see it, it hasthe potential to be a very good and entertaining motion picture.ABOUTFUNDING AND ALL THAT PHASE TALKSofar the project has cost a bit over $40K. It needs $95,000.00 to becompleted, $45,000.00 for PHASE I and $50,000.00 for PHASE II.PHASEI will pay for acquisition of additional footage of the airplaneinterior (green screen), additional B-roll (approximately anotherthirty hours), picture lock and sound design with the score.Ifthe goal is exceeded, the extra funds will be used for PHASE II,which includes creation of CG elements – airplane models (three –one small for wide shots, medium and a highly detailed one forextreme closeups (the original script had only noise and the shadowof the plane in it). Those CG shots will add a tremendous productionvalue to the movie), animation (cloud particles and rain sequence), compositing and color correction.Alot of shots need rotoscoping to fix up reflections and the depth offield (bad lens issue). This phase will also tackle title sequenceand animated transitions.Letme say a few words about the release schedule. The planned release isFall of 2014. Does it really take that long, you might ask?Unfortunately, it does. Let me explain.Thereare 65 scenes in the script, some long, some short. The airplane willadd 5 more. Footage wise, each scene was shot from a minimum of threedifferent angles with four takes per shot in average. We wereshooting two hours of footage per day, give or take. Multiply thatwith twenty seven days and you get fifty four hours of footage. Thatis without the B-roll, which is another twenty plus hours.Inaverage it takes four days to rough cut the scene. If you multiply thatwith sixty five scenes you end up with roughly nine months of editingonly, without the B-roll and the plane shots.EARLY COMPOSITING TESTSOnthe visual side, once editing is done there is another beast totackle. Compositing. Ifyou didn't, please check out COMPOSITING TESTS video clip. You willnotice that each take is repeated twice. First time in the originalform, and the second time with compositing effect.Sincewe couldn't drive the squad, we had to cheat. The car was parked andOfficer Jack was pretending he's driving.  To fix that, every bit ofscenery visible through the windows needs to be replaced with themoving background. And that's the easy part. Now, did you noticeanything odd with Police Officer's glasses? No? Check it out againand you'll see. Reflections in his glasses are that of a driveway,not a moving street. All that needs to be cleaned up and replaced aswell.Thereare plenty of shots needing similar treatment as well. You know howthe movie business works; if there is no budget for it, you cheat andthen fix it in the post - if you can.Well,you got a taste of what lies ahead on the visual side (not includingthe CG elements). I won't go into the score and sound design. That'sanother beast in it's own right. In short, it takes a lot of work tomake the movie look and feel rightB_Roll Sampler - footage is not color corrected or cleaned (city lights, cars and people have to be removed). This is just to give you a feel for some of the visuals in the movieForthree years I was trying to do it by putting every penny and sparetime into it, but it was a constant catching up game. I would get atop of the line computer and guess what? It's not fast enough and Ihad to upgrade. I would add plenty of storage space and realize it'snot nearly enough, because now the pipeline is changed to accommodateuncompressed edit, or compositing will not work out. So I had to addten more drives. And those issues are just the tip of the iceberg.Wehope “Where is Hank?” has sparked your curiosity and, like us,will want to see it finished. Please help us reach our goal andmake us proud with this project. Good movies can touch the heart, andwe hope “Where is Hank?” has touched yours.IFI PLEDGE, WHAT WILL I GET?Hugsand Kisses! Well, not really. As the next best thing you will receiveone or more movie memorabilia, DVD and the Blu Ray (depending on your pledge amount) andyour name will be immortalized for posterity in the movie credits(again, depending on your pledge amount). Not so shabby, huh? You canfind the details in the pledge amount section. Hereis the sampler of some of our unique memorabilia. Enjoy!And for the end, this is my old reel. It's far from perfect, but I was young then.

Squatch Watchers|failed|"SQUATCH WATCHERS TEASER #3What is Squatch Watchers?Squatch Watchers is a web series about a team of Bigfoot believers that are searching for the mysterious and elusive beast. So, wait? Is this fictional?No! The Squatch Watchers are comprised of real people and the series will document our search for Bigfoot. The first season will comprise of five episodes with a running time of around ten minutes each. Each episode begins with the team arriving in a new area of California and extensively searching it for any sign of Sasquatch. Local residents will be interviewed; scientists will be consulted to ensure the validity of this search. No rock will be left undisturbed until we declare an area is free of any Bigfoot.Why are you looking for Bigfoot? Aren’t there TV Shows that do that?We’re all big believers in Bigfoot. Sadly, television is doing a poor job of actually performing a real search. Most “monster” shows will show up in an area, and then leave that area without finding anything or even making any determination at all! WE WILL NEVER DO THAT. We’re not a television show that wants to keep the mystery going. We want to solve it. Now, this doesn’t mean that the show will be boring. No sir! We are internet comedians after all. Each episode will be the perfect 50/50 mixture of comedy and actual Bigfoot hunting. Who the heck are you guys?We already told you. We’re the Squatch Watchers!Be more specific!The Squatch Watchers are made up of Gene Shaw, Jerry Ahern, Jason Inman and Jen Trani. Jason and Gene will be co-directing the series. Each has years of experience in film, internet and commercial production.  Jason currently produces, shoots and edits for Youtube comedy duo, Rhett & Link. He also creates videos on his own YouTube channel (Jawiin) which has over 2.5 million views collectively. Gene is no slouch either. He has over a decade of experience in graphic design and illustration. His other credits include several AAA video games, best selling iPhone/iPad and Android apps and feature film editing and visual effects.Jason and Gene are also no strangers to shooting in the woods. Check out The Walking Dead Christmas Special, a video they co-created that won Best Parody Video at the 2013 Geeky Awards.Jason and Gene will also be helped out by the following:Scott Lobdell - A world famous comic book writer who has written acclaimed runs on Superman, X-Men, and Teen Titans. He has fallen in love with Bigfoot ever since writing about the creature in the pages of Alpha Flight.Chuck Testa - The internet's most famous taxidermist and Bigfoot believer. Chuck was named by Time Magazine one of 2011's top internet memes. Most well known for telling people, ""NOPE!""Jen Trani - Brilliant musician and internet famous guitarist who has released multiple albums and played in such bands as Jen & Abby and Malin Akerman and the Mystikats. She wants to use music to aid in the search for Bigfoot. Jerry Ahern - A comic book and Sasquatch lover who brings an enthusiastic and energetic drive to the search. Also the former host of the Cape Town Community Podcast.Why do you need me?The search for Bigfoot is actually a lot more difficult than it sounds. It’s not as simple as hopping in your car and beating on some trees, as some shows would have you believe. In fact, a large portion of the budget is strictly for traveling expenses. We want to make sure that we can get to the areas that have the most reported sightings of our big hairy friend. For the first season, the search will be limited to the state of California. But for Season 2, we want to expand to some of the northern states like Oregon and Washington.Wait, you’re already talking about Season 2?Of course! Our quest to find the Squatch only ends when we find him. First, we document California squatches, then we broaden the search to find out where else this elusive beast is camping out. We’ve put together the numbers and the budget we need is exactly the amount we are asking for. No more, no less. There are no line items for trips to Hawaii in this budget. That’s Season 4. So humbly and on bended knee, we turn to you to help us fund our search for Bigfoot.So what do I get for contributing?Limited time reward!

Zen in America: a film on Zen Buddhism in North America|successful|"* STRETCH GOAL ADDED: We've reached the minimum goal of $10,000, so the project is funded! However, as I discuss in the video and on this page, the estimated cost of the film in the end will be between $20,000 and $30,000. Any closer we can get to that goal will be of great help.ZEN IN AMERICA: A documentary film about Zen Buddhism in North America is the first documentary series of its kind to thoroughly examine the history and practices of Zen in North America. The series will take us to Zen temples throughout North America to show how Zen Buddhism is being expressed in our modern culture – gathering intimate accounts and insights from the teachers, practitioners and scholars of the tradition today. I began filming for the series in July of 2013. Over the next several years of my life, I will visit the many practice centers here in North America to document this diverse Buddhist tradition on film. It is my hope that you will be inspired to contribute to the documentary, help get the word out, and take some time to learn about the project today. Connect with us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Subscribe to our YouTube channel Visit the Zen in America websiteWatch the trailer for the filmWHAT THIS FILM SERIES WILL EXPLOREFrom the mid-19th century on more Americans have been reading about the teachings of Zen, finding wisdom and insight in what it has to teach us and inspiring many to take up its practice. What started out as a tradition we had inherited from early Japanese, Korean, Chinese and Vietnamese founders is today being carried forward by an ever growing number of Americans. From the more traditional practices to the more radically liberal in approach, Zen Buddhism is being simultaneously maintained and reshaped in the American grain.From the World Parliament of Religions to modern day, this important series will ask and endeavor to answer: How did Zen first arrive here? Who were its original pioneers? What are the various schools and lineages we see in North America today? What are the practices and ceremonies of Zen? How has the Zen landscape changed since those early years? What does a term like American Zen even mean? Does it exist and, if it does, what are some of its defining characteristics? What is the face of Zen Buddhism in North America today? What has been learned so far from this great experiment, from our many successes and failures?Above all else, this documentary series will strive to answer the most pressing question of all – ""What does this ancient, East Asian inheritance have to contribute to our modern American society?""THE STORY BEHIND THE FILM""Zen in America"" tells the story of Zen Buddhism in North America through a patchwork of interviews with teachers of all North American Zen lines, recollections and experiences of practitioners, analysis by scholars and academics, archival footage and photographs, and footage shot on location. Over the coming years, director Adam Kō Shin Tebbe will travel throughout North America to talk to the leaders and practitioners of the tradition. Having only begun shooting for the film in July of 2013, the film already includes interviews with the following American Zen teachers:Sojun Mel Weitsman, Hozan Alan Senauke, James Myoun Ford, Myoan Grace Schireson, Myo Denis Lahey, Jay Rinsen Weik, Karen Do'on Weik, as well as many North American practitioners.WHAT IS NEEDED TO SUCCEEDMaking this documentary series will take me on an amazing journey for the next number of years. I need your help and support today to help me get out on the road to continue filming. Logistically, I have everything I need to make this film: camera gear, lighting, laptops and storage for the film. What I need your help with today is getting (and keeping me) out on the road for the coming years of my life to continue collecting footage and interviews with some of America's leading voices on the Zen tradition. I will use rental cars and grab flights to do most of the legwork, and will stay in the homes of others, sleep in my car, or stay over at Zen temples when at a new location. Except in the case of some kind of an emergency, I do not plan to use hotels or motels for lodging (though I may camp).I have set a minimum goal of $10,000,which will get me out there and on the road filming. This story cannot be told without overwhelming support from backers. Realistically, this film will require $20,000 to $30,000 in the end to get to the many practice locations scattered throughout North America. How to help: By supporting our Kickstarter campaign for ZEN IN AMERICA, you can help us meet our outlined goals!Funds will be used for:Rental carsFlightsGasFood Emergency lodgingMiscellaneous equipmentREWARDSMAKE A CONTRIBUTION TO THE FILM AND RECEIVE REWARDSChoose what amount you want to give and what reward you would like to receive.

Deliberately austere, my compositions focus one’s attention to the detailed renderings of natural and man-made items that play out their balancing act on the painted stage. Wabi-sabi is a belief that all things living are imperfect, impermanent and incomplete. Things that are humble and modest are therefore beautiful in a small and quiet way. I try to capture this simple and understated beauty in nature.""Learn more about Stroman's work: http://www.bradstroman.com/1 HOUR PLANE RIDE AROUND SEATTLE$300 level: Licensed pilot and Rinzai Zen priest Genjo Marinello of Seattle’s Chobo-ji, who will be featured in the documentary series, is offering a one-hour plane ride around Seattle to two individuals on a date you and he determine.

WE ARE ONE: STREET MUSIC OF NEW ORLEANS|failed|“We Are One: Street Music of New Orleans”    “We Are One: Street Music of New Orleans,” is a spectacle of harmonious images and rhythm that encompasses the most unique city in America, New Orleans, Louisiana. In this city there is a pulse that beats with the bottom of a bass drum. The people of New Orleans walk, talk, breathe, and live by a rhythm unmatched and it doesn’t have to be justified. It just is. Social conditions become submissive to the quality of life in this city. Out of despair, poverty, corruption, etc. the emergence of the holy trinity of street music makes its mark.     Take a 90 minute journey through the streets of New Orleans as the soundtrack is set by native Brass, Rap, and Bounce in a way that only “The Big Easy” can do it. The accents speak the language, the food satisfies the palette, but the music fills in whatever else is lacking. You will never find a more culturally diverse city as New Orleans. The purpose of this film highlights that diversity and aims to lift the consciousness of the unaware. The rich spiritual history of the music comes through in many ways and the spotlight shines brightly on New Orleans. Starring in this film are legendary names such as: Partners n Crime, Cheeky Blakk, Ice Mike, Black Menace, Bust Down, Mr. Serv On, with special appearances by Youngfellaz Brass Band and The Original Pinettes Brass Band.      This project is completed through the principal photography phase and is currently in post-production. What I am seeking funding for is to assist in the costs of post-production and marketing and promotions. 
Star and the Snowman|successful|"A hitman known only as The Snowman.  A call girl known only as Star.  Not their real names, obviously, but real names are a liability in the shadowy underworld these characters inhabit.   Star and the Snowman is the story of two people searching for ""normal"" in a world of death, betrayal, and revenge.  Snowman is a killer born into a family of violence; he knows no other way of life.  Star is a woman out of control in a whirlwind of drugs and sex, unable to focus a damaged mind long enough to find an exit.  When Snowman's latest job threatens to rip open some very old wounds for them both, they find themselves torn between the opportunity to escape this hellish life, and the need to finally learn the truth about a decades-old secret which began the whole nightmare.  But in their world, learning the truth always comes with a heavy price, and such debts can only be paid in blood...    On the surface, Star and the Snowman is a crime drama, but like the characters themselves, the film is determined to tear beneath that surface.  It's a tale not only of guns and gangsters, but also of the depths to which the human soul can fall, and of the courage and strength needed to climb into the light again.  The filmmakers' intent is to transcend the conventions of genre, creating a universally potent drama whose bedrock will be the authenticity of its lead characters: two people struggling against a cruel world, armed only with the same hopes and dreams all of us share. We are Ohio-based filmmakers on a mission - a mission to produce world-class independent films in Ohio that can compete in the broader feature film market. Not an easy task.In the spring of 2012, we shot three scenes from the script as a proof-of-concept to illustrate director John Whitney’s vision for Star and the Snowman.These sample scenes were produced with the help of a professional volunteer crew dedicated to the film's success. That's the key. The most critical element of our plan is to surround ourselves with seasoned professionals that love the process of filmmaking and believe in us and our vision of making quality films.The one thing that weare sure of is that as filmmakers, we enjoy compelling stories aboutpeople who have been placed at a crossroads. In our past work, themesof loss and how people navigate life changes are what have driven uscreatively.  Fictional stories with one foot in reality that immerseaudiences in familiar worlds while asking questions, giving fewanswers and having the filmgoer ask themselves, “Whatwould I do?”  Wefeel this is essential to telling original and compelling stories. 	Becauseof the type of worlds in which our stories are set, we're able to useexisting locations to communicate the visual tone of our films. Bydoing this, our brand of filmmaking remains cost-effective andefficient without compromising quality or production value. Ourapproach follows in the footsteps of successful independent filmslike Sundance Grand Prize winning Winter’sBone and JeffNichols’ TakeShelter, which was shot and produced here in Ohio.These films were done with modest budgets. Bybringing together a talented team and working from a great script,they tell human stories that truly connect with the audience in a waythat has resulted in critical and commercial success. This mirrorsour philosophy.Because you want to see good movies made. Because you want to see THIS movie made. Because you're a good person. Because when this movie is completed, you can say, ""Oh, yeah. I helped make that happen."" And because you're a good person. I know...we said that twice but it's true. Lets make this happen.What if I can’t pledge right now?  No problem! You can still help us by sharing this page with your friends, family, and colleagues and spreading the word about our film and campaign.  Tweet us, share us, like us on Facebook—every bit helps.Every dime of what we raise through Kickstarter will go toward the three parts that make up phase one of producing Star and the Snowman.Part One -  Winter Scenes and 2nd Unit ExteriorsThe stark, gray Ohio winter itself is like a character in Star and the Snowman, and is essential to the tone and setting of the film. The winter weather is something we can't recreate - we have to capture the film's establishing shots, exteriors and footage for the title sequence in Steubenville and Mingo Junction, Ohio before we move into spring.  At the same time, additional shooting of winter urban landscapes will take place in Columbus and Cleveland as well.  This is an important element in the film. The mood we establish in the opening of the film and the atmosphere we infuse throughout the film is PARAMOUNT... so we feel that if we snooze, we lose on this. Part Two - CastingCasting an independent film is a delicate process and critical to the film’s success. If we don't handle it properly, we will have failed as filmmakers. While the majority of the roles in the film will be cast with regional actors, we think it's important to cast familiar faces in key supporting roles to better position ourselves when we offer the film to distributors.  To do this, we will be working with a Los Angeles-based casting director.Part Three – ProductionWe need funding for continued preproduction and materials for phase two of production, principal photography and additional fundraising.  We all know that Kickstarter is a powerful crowd-funding tool, but we can't rely on it alone to make the film happen. Kickstarter will also help us reach out to well-heeled individuals to help with our future funding goals. We also need to produce additional materials that will help us with further development, sales and marketing of the film.  If you want to build a house, you must have the proper tools.  Exciting and eye-catching materials that speak to the potential investor and outline our plan are paramount to the film's success.We have been working in production for over 20 years and have done everything from PA work to producing feature films.  And the takeaway from all of this experience is that we have the knowledge of what works and what doesn’t work in independent filmmaking.  We're in the process of building a strong creative team and crew made up of talented individuals who are dedicated to creating work of surpassing quality…and this is the start.John Whitney – the directorOur director is award-winning filmmaker John Whitney.  John’s films have played in festivals across the country and garnered a number of awards. His films A Passion for Filmmaking and The Fixer have screened on the Independent Film Channel (IFC). Check out his latest film Eroded which has garnered many awards.Bill Farmer – the writerThe script was written by two-time Nicholl Fellowship finalist William Farmer.  Bill is a seasoned Hollywood screenwriter who has optioned multiple scripts and most recently received story credit on the big budget film, Jonah Hex starring Josh Brolin.  We are extremely lucky to have Bill on board and feel that the script is fantastic.Kevin McClatchy – the leadKevin has been cast in the lead role in the film.  He is a member of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG), and has appeared in feature films and television programs including Unstoppable, Love and Other Drugs, NCIS, The X-Files, and General Hospital.  Kevin is also an accomplished stage actor and recently appeared in the CATCO production of Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo.Phil Garrett – producerPhil has 20 feature films under his belt in positions ranging from his earlydays as a production assistant to writing and producing. Phil'sexperience includes studio features and independent films in liveaction, animation, and visual effects, and his body of work includesprojects at DreamWorksAnimation SKG,PDI, and Disney.Dino Tripodis – producer & playing the role of “Frank” in the filmDino started Never the Luck Productions five years ago and produced the festival award-winning feature film Minus One, the short films The Funnyman and Happy Endings. Dino also served as co-producer on John Whitney's and Phil Garrett's award-winning short film Eroded.  He currently serves as Executive Producer of Nite Owl Theatre, an online series now in its second season.Gil Whitney – the cinematographerGil brings his talents and unique visual style to this film. He has worked on many independent short films and features and recently the documentary feature Meet the Phantods. Gil is also known for his award-winning cinematography on the short films Measured Sacrifice and The Fixer, which was broadcast on the Independent Film Channel.Michelle Messenger Garrett – publicist/PR coordinatorMichelle is a public relations consultant and award-winning writer with more than 20 years of experience executing successful PR strategies for companies ranging in size from small and startup businesses to enterprises such as Adobe and HP.

I'LL SEE YOU IN MY DREAMS - narrative feature film|successful|"STORYI'LL SEE YOU IN MY DREAMS tells the story of Carol (Blythe Danner), a widow in her 70s, who is struggling to find purpose and make sense of her increasingly isolated life in the ""twilight"" years. After the death of her dog rattles her routine, she decides to start dating again, and falls into relationships with two very different men -- the senior, exuberant Bill, who embraces life in the moment, and her younger pool cleaner, Lloyd (Martin Starr), who is struggling to find his purpose, much like Carol. Through these new relationships, Carol confronts her fears about love, family, aging, and death and is forced to adopt a new outlook as she comes to terms with this new phase of her life.I'LL SEE YOU IN MY DREAMS is a deceptively small story, but it asks big questions. The setting, characters, and honest, human approach make this a surprising and unique film. This is not an ""old person"" movie.

It won the Audience Award for Best Narrative Feature at the Sarasota Film Festival and was a Critic’s Pick in The Village Voice and LA Weekly. The film is 100% 'fresh' on www.RottenTomatoes.com. The New York Times said of the film, ""Out of raw materials, convincing 20-something dialogue, deft montages of night life, bowling, parties, the beachside setting - the director-screenwriter Brett Haley has built an encouraging feature film debut."" It was theatrically released in NY, LA and Florida before finding digital distribution.REBECCA GREEN (Producer)Rebecca Green is currently in post-production on the feature film IT FOLLOWS, written and directed by David Robert Mitchell, whose debut feature, THE MYTH OF THE AMERICAN SLEEPOVER, premiered at SXSW and went on to screen at the Cannes Film Festival.

UNDERWATER|successful|UNDERWATER is a half-hour comedic TV pilot about a couple in LA whoare so underwater on their mortgage that they can’t afford to break up… It’s alighthearted look at a situation more and more people are finding themselvesin—and one that ripples outwards to affect the couple’s friends and family insurprising ways.Co-written by Nathan Marshall and Michael Traynor, we arenow turning to the Kickstarter community with the goal of raising funds tofinish the project. We’ve written it. We’ve shot it. We’ve edited it.  And now we need your help to get ourshow through the final post-production steps so we can start sharing it withthe world!Wait—you already shot it?Yup! After years of paying dues and working on otherpeople’s projects, we wondered what would happen if we took matters into ourown hands. So we did! We looked around for inspiration, saw an America in recovery andconnected with all those folks who weren’t winning—and weren’t losing either—but were instead putting up a fight andmerely trying to keep their headsabove water. A couple underwater on their home and trapped in a fading marriageseemed like a great (and hilarious!)place to start—and the theme of “trying” became our meme.When the script was done, we were determined to make thisbaby happen—and started by calling everyone we knew to see if anyone could helppass the script on to a few excellent TV stars. Incredibly, the scriptresonated with folks and we were able to attach our dream cast, includingRachel Nichols (Criminal Minds, GI Joe), Brooke Nevin (BreakoutKings, The 4400) and Barry Bostwick (SpinCity, Cougartown). Our other excellent castmembers included Jude Angelini, Jacory Gums, Maura Murphy and Chris Wylde.Pawning vital organs(including some of our own) to cobble together production funding, we finallyshot the show over seven whirlwind days with an awesome crew filled to the brimwith passion, skill and energy drinks. Then—over the last three months, we’ve whittled the footage down into a tight, fast-moving, super-funny pilot that we can’t wait tostart showing people…And that’s where you come in!We shot Underwater for next to nothing with every dollar spent wisely. But we still have a fewcritical steps to complete the editing process. By sheer magic our show looks like a big-dollar production—but togive it the best chance to get seen, compete with the big dogs and hopefullystart airing(!), we need to clean up the sound, fix the color, and produce astack of DVDs and promotional materials.We’ll post updates over the course of our Kickstarter runand will check in daily to answer any questions you might have about theshow... We could keep typing here, but really all we need to say is THANK YOU. Yourdonation means the completion of a dream that we’ve both had for many, many years—and weabsolutely can’t wait to share Underwater with all of you! 
The Fanalyzers: Views from the Stands|failed|"""The Fanalyzers"" will be a 30 minute weekly sports talk show that focuses on hot sports topics, news and games of the week. Fans today are more astute on sports and their teams. This show provides a venue for fans all over in diverse settings to give their thoughts and opinions on various topics. Filming will be conducted at barbershops, various major sporting events etc. and will focus on the largest demographic in sports - the fan.One of the ""draws"" of ""The Fanalyzers"" is the group's diversity - not only gender and racial, but geographic as well. Everyone in the group is from a different part of the country - therefore providing a different view and vantage point on sports. Currently, there are 15 rotating segments that will be used on the show with the potential for more to be created as the show evolves.  At 100% funding, we will produce ten-webisodes of ""The Fanalyzers"" that we air on the website for the show. Episodes will be ""fresh"" and based on the trending sports news of the time. For example, if will begin shooting in November, an episode may feature talk around NFL games of the week, the start of the NBA season and college football conference match-ups. Games that may be debated will be chosen based on poll-results on the website from fan voting. "

Its a mad dash as we absorb as much of the local culture as possible.Following are some of the locations that we are scouting to film for Season One.  Barcelona, SpainKiev, UkraineVienna, AustriaBuenos Aires, ArgentinaSao Paulo, BrazilMumbai, IndiaSydney, AustraliaTokyo, Japan.With this campaign, you are not backing one episode.  You are backing the entire first season--six episodes!  However, the greater the support we receive through Kickstarter, the more locations we can visit and more episodes we will be able to add to our original planned six.  We would love to hear your ideas for other locations.  What foods/drinks should we experience?  What people should we meet?  Meet the TeamWe are excited to have a strong group of very dynamic, entertaining personalities on-board that produceprojects on stage and screen throughout the United States.  Jonathan Lindsey - Producer, Co-HostDabney Hopkins - Co-HostKaren Vizzard - Co-HostLainey Silver - Co-HostRyan Rahn - Director, CinematographerMiguel Gonzalez - co-Director, CinematographerJesus Valdez - CinematographerKelli Tresgallo - Cinematographer, PhotographerOur Progress So FarSix months ago we began working full time on this project.  In that time we have auditioned for and engaged dynamic hosts and amazingly talented crew.  We have completed location research for Seasons One and Two; researched and planned episodes; and had pre-production meetings in which all cast and crew flew in to collaborate creatively, work through logistics (the inherent chemistry from day one of everyone involved has been amazing), and film promo shots and preliminary material.We have already begun episode 1!  On August 7th, 2013 we began filming the pilot episode on location.  Filming of the episode was completed on August 10th, with post-production currently underway and expected to be complete by September 1st.   This episode alone went amazingly well and we are excited to present to you the full spectrum of experiences we faced, from the awe-inspiring to the downright challenging.Behind the scenes...Production Still (Sound check and last minute notes, June 22, 2013)The Road AheadWe are scheduled to continue principle photography in two-week regional expeditions in October, December, and January.  These regional trips allow us to maximize resources and significantly reduce production costs.  Writing, editing, voice-overs, computer graphics, and other post-production work will occur immediately upon return from each of the filming expeditions.  This will also allow certain efficiencies, but more importantly allow us to deliver Season One in Spring 2014.Here is Where You Come InWe know people love the adventure ofexploring new places and discovering new things, and we know people love tolaugh and be engaged. We are bringing these loves togetherinto this very unique show.As you can see from the still photos and clips, this is already starting to look amazing.  The work we have done sofar has been brought to life by extremely talented artists in front of andbehind the camera.However, the costs of creating a sleek, exceptional series adds up fast.  We aspire to create the highest-possible-qualityentertainment for you and we need YOUR help to do so.Through pledges starting at just $5, you will be involved in the creative process from beginning to end.  You will be able to stay updated on shoots and behind-the-scenes sneak peeks, learn something new, have amazing personal experiences with the hosts, and even join us on location as a guest in an episode...all the while supporting an incredible project and show.Kickstarter GoalsEveryone from cast to crew is donating their time to the project because we believe so much in this project.  But there are some very real costs.  The largest part of our budget is for the expense of transportation of cast and crew to filming locations.  We have therefore set a series of goals that will allow us to make the best possible show for you.Our initial goal of $29,700 will allow us to film and produce a six episode first season.  That may sound like a lot, but in the TV world its not.  If we reach our second goal of $44,550 we will expand the first season to include eight episodes and they will be amazing.  If we reach our third goal of $56,600 we will be able to stretch the first season to 10 episodes that will blow your mind.  Can we exceed our goals?  Yes!  Anything over our initial goals will allow us to keep making the best episodes we possibly can until all funds run out.  Every dollar we raise will be clearly represented on screen.  Everything else will be accomplished by being smart and doing a lot with a little.The RewardsWe have some amazing rewards for everyone at all different levels of support.  We do know that a lot of people will hear of Uncommon Rhythm because of our hosts--the uniquely talented and dynamic on-screen personalities you will see.  So we thought we would also include some rewards that honor that unique-ness.  All of the rewards have been carefully crafted and are exclusive to our Kickstarter Supporters.  Remember, every dollar you pledge goes directly into the series.  By choosing to support the project you are ensuring that we can make an even better project.Note:  Travel, lodging and transportation to events and location visits not included unless specifically stated.  Must be over 18 or accompanied by aparent or legal guardian to attend events (premiere, set visits, specialactivites).  Some rewards may require additional paperwork (to protect us andyou)Where the Money GoesOur largest expenses are related to transportation of cast and crew to filming locations.  Other expenses include:  insurance, permits and legal fees, media storage costs (filming this much material in high-definition requires a lot of digital storage space), and post-production expenses.  Following is our projected budget to film and produce a six episode first season.Other Ways You Can HelpSpread the word!  Tell everyone you know about Uncommon Rhythm.  Like us on Facebook, follow us on Twitter, spread it throughout social media with #uncommonrhythm, blog it, or promote it any way that comes to mind.  Everything helps.If you have location suggestions, or even better ""connections"", with any of the international locations, please email us.  Final ThoughtsWe feel this is an amazing project and think you will too.  We appreciate your time in reading about the show and we appreciate your consideration of any level of support.  Thank you for believing in us and our passion for this project!Sponsors"

Los Angeles International Student Film Festival|successful|What is LA Int'l Student Film Fest?The Los Angeles International Student Film Festival will take place June 7th, 2014. Located in Downtown, Los Angeles at Regal Cinemas LA Live the festival will help deepen the already burgeoning artistic community in downtown by exhibiting student films from not only the Los Angeles area, but from international cities spanning the globe. While there are many film festivals in the LA area there are few dedicated solely to supporting student filmmakers and even less that include high school, undergraduate and graduate students in the same festival. Our programming is aimed towards creating a rich pallet of unique perspectives from around the world thereby exposing our audience to new concepts, stories, and people. LA International Student Film Fest is a project of the Pasadena Arts Council’s EMERGE Fiscal Sponsorship Program. Donations to the festival are tax deductible under Federal ID 95-2540759. The Pasadena Arts Council is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization that has been facilitating, empowering and advocating for the arts since 1964. What your donation will go towards?Our goal here on Kickstarter is to get to $1,500 and we can only do that with your help! The $1,500 will go towards helping us pay for the theater space at Regal Cinemas LA Live where the screenings will take place and for the Closing Ceremony where Student Awards will be announced and filmmakers can network and discuss their work!Any extra donations that take us above our goal will go towards program and operating expenses that make the festival possible and help us create an even better experience for all the audience members and filmmakers involved. Why Support Young Filmmakers?With nationwide budget cuts to education, support for art programs and specifically film programs that require expensive equipment, has become less of a priority to schools who are more focused on students standardized test scores. This in turn leaves students with only half the means they need to achieve a well rounded education and discourages them from self expression that is vital to our societal health and capacity for growth.Throughout history art has been one of our strongest forms of communication and an indicator of what is happening in our society. Now in the twenty first century the art of filmmaking is one of our most capable tools for students to tell their stories through and it is one of the least supported in our school systems.You Can Help Us Provide a Solution. The Los Angeles International Student Film Festival will fill this void by creating support for students where schools may be lacking. We will host an annual film festival dedicated solely to screening work created by students enrolled in high school, undergraduate and graduate programs. By focusing on student films on an international level we are bringing together a global community of filmmakers who share the common goal of education and artistic expression. Through celebrating filmmakers at varying stages in their schooling we strive to create a dynamic environment that offers inspiration and valuable networking opportunities. Most importantly the festival will give talented students a sound board from which to be heard and motivate them to further explore their craft and grow as artists.

PATTY AT THE PARTY - a mumblecore horror feature|failed|"MONGREL COLLECTIVE is a progressive guerrilla movie company in Los Angeles operating outside of Hollywood and the ""indy"" scene. MONGREL is a non profit group who uses high definition technology and the internet to prove that there are alternative ways of making cool movies. We go into a particular environment and collaborate with the community.MONGREL was created by Adam Haynes, a professional screenwriter and graduate of The American Film Institute, one year ago as an attempt to employ the garage punk methodology to making movies. Using craigslist he assembled a core group of multi talented artists and craftsmen. Everyone involved donated their time and their talents and understood that all money spent would be on either food or technical aspects of production, and that all money made would go into further productions or to support the non profit itself.Over the course of the year, two features were made from community donations. The first was a crime thriller titled DIRTY RED HANDS, shot last spring in five days for 500 dollars, and the second was a supernatural thriller called SPIRITEUR, shot last fall in nine days for 800 dollars. Both are currently being edited at MONGREL headquarters. Information and photos related to both movies can be found at either mmmmmongrel.blogspot.com, or by looking up the mmmmmongrel group on facebook.We've learned a lot from making these two features and will be bringing all that knowledge into our third feature, PATTY AT THE PARTY, which will be used to officially launch our website and help get our non profit solvent.For PATTY AT THE PARTY we've partnered up with the Silver/Echo gallery in Echo Park. We workshopped with members of that area's artistic community to create really weird and interesting characters and scenarios, which Adam then used to create a screenplay. PATTY AT THE PARTY is a mumble core horror comedy - think Paul Bartel meets Andrew Bujalski. It tells three separate, interconnected stories about gorgeous, desperate hipsters who, over the course of an afternoon and evening, mistake love for violence, mutilation, and murder.Check out our teaser, which was shot mongrel style on a budget of seven bucks:http://www.youtube.com/watch...Through the fund raising efforts of Silver/Echo as well as community donations we've raised $14,000 for the production proper, which will start in the middle of June. We want to raise at least an additional $5000 to cover post production and marketing needs.MONGREL COLLECTIVE would love to come to your community and make a movie with you and your friends, the sort of movie Hollywood would never make, the sort of movie you've always wanted to see. If you donate to PATTY AT THE PARTY you'll be joining the bigger MONGREL party and helping to make this exciting cinematic revolution possible."
AllThis TV|failed|Making things happen and making a dream come true! This is a show that i have been developing for some time now. It is a comedic, inside look to a job that many people know about, but don't really know how it works.

If I can some how pull off getting this show funded, I know it's going places!As I mentioned before, I've had the script read by several people in the industry and they love it. They love the characters, the writing and the whole foundation and concept of the show. They have no doubt that if I can get this show off the ground, it will get picked up. If I can get the funding for this show, I'll have a complete package developed to pitch it to TV networks once the first season premiers on the web.So what's in it for you? You would be helping support everyone involved in the journey as well as receive credit for helping fund this project. Not only will you have your name appear, you could even receive a shout out at the end of an episode, or better yet, have the chance to appear in an episode!

Spirits Asunder|failed|"SummarySpirits Asunder is a full cinema length feature film being produced and shot in the South coast of England. It is an apocalyptic supernatural thriller.Draft concept for one of the postersThe film is based on the novel, Spirits Asunder, which itself is the first on a series consisting of 3 novels and the producer/writer/director of the film is the author of the novel, as such WE ARE IN A UNIQUE POSITIONCover for the bookHere is the plot outline""The spirit of a deceased young adult returns among the living. His girlfriend, adamant to uncover the truth behind the death closed down by police as undecipherable, enlists the aid of some friends. Together, they conduct a series of seances to make contact with the spirit world, which leads them to a quest.Joining them in their quest is an eccentric genius and an Angel sent from the heavens. When they discover the death is connected to a series of deaths going back over half a century by an entity; a powerful confrontation ensues. But when an ancient evil which had lain dormant for a thousand years is awoken in the process with devastating results, the fate of the entire planet rests on the shoulders of few.""This project has grown beyond what the producer envisioned when the film was conceived and in pre production. We are lucky enough to have on board a talented pool of cast and crew, ranging from those starting in the industry to seasoned veterans.  Plus, we have a professionally composed, cinematic soundtrack from composers who are veterans right at the top of their industry. As such, we have beautifully composed orchestral pieces which range from subtle to epic, depending on scene requirements (Select 'battle scenes' music are pretty epic)One major aspect of the film is the use of Ki energy. Japanese and Chinese study says every living being has energy within them which they use to move around, this is called Ki or Chi energy. In the film, some characters are able to manipulate this energy and bring it forth to be used as a deadly weapon. A  still from a scene in the film showing draft concept of Ki energy for the filmWe have already filmed the vast majority of the production and as such we can guarantee the film will be completed, therefore perks will be given out. But with YOUR help, we can increase the timescale and efficiency in which the film can be released.Production still from one of the seance scenesProduction still from one of the seance scenesConcept art for the angel       Now, without giving too much away at this stage, there is a lead up to an apocalyptic situation, an ""end of the word"" scenario of which the catalyst being a series of seances disturbing the supernatural world. we have a scene where the Prime Minister of the UK calls his cabinet to try and deal with the immeasurable instability of the planet. Of course, the planet's hope rests on the protagonists and the PM's cabinet is limited in what they can do. We are fortunate enough to have on board a talented actor to portray the Prime Minister, who not only looks similar to Prime Minister David Cameron but has portrayed him on national television.What We Need We realise that we have a very modest goal amount for our feature film but as we have completed pre production and a lot of principle photography (filming) is complete, we are well on the road to get the film out. But with help from contributors this can be achieved on a more efficient scale. We still have scenes to film and we still have post productionWhere will the money go?We have very limited on resources, but we have not let that stop us from doing the best we can. With additional funds we can hire additional equipment, contribute towards catering for the cast and crew. But what will really need financing is post production. We plan to utilise top of the range post production software, including motion graphics software, in order to create the special effects, (of which are lighting; earthquakes; Ki energy formations to name a few) to do the film justice. Not to mention financing for the professional, high quality soundtrack. For that, we need to invest in the hardware and software capable of delivering the results the film needs.If we are fortunate enough to reach our goal, we will then stretch it which will then be invested in the camera and lenses budget to give the film an even more cinematic look, as well as money put aside to send to national and international film festivalsWhat you getWe have a range of perks for our supporters. As well as signed posters, T shirts, special pens, we are also offering digital and paperback versions of Spirits Asunder; the novel, a chance to be in the film, video chat with the producer, imdb credits and as well as of course the film itself!LocationAs this is being filmed in Bournemouth, Dorset, the South of England, we have access to naturally beautiful and scenic locations, which we have utilised for the film.       Production still from a scene in the filmThe ImpactWe have very ambitious plans for this project. The film is based on the novel so of course the novel will be released. We also have plans for a radio adaptation, Spirits Asunder themed merchandise, a spin off web series and potentially a theatre adaptation if we can generate enough interest.If the film does well, we hope to secure investment and funding for the sequels. Should we be fortunate enough to get to that stage, we plan to offer our fans and supporters the opportunity to get involved with the production and receive perks!So at the end of the day, you aren't just supporting a film, you are supporting an entertainment package!Other Ways You Can HelpIf you wish to help this project in non-financial means, please spread the word, link  our facebook page and our campaign page.Thanks!Cast Please visit our imdb page for cast details"

Kaleidoscope Man|failed|Hi, I’m Simon Cox, the writer and director of a thrilling new science fiction movie, Kaleidoscope Man.  When I was a child and saw the original Star Wars, it changed my life. I knew then that I wanted to be a film director and that some day I would make a sci-fi movie that would thrill, inspire and blow audiences away - just like Star Wars did for me...Kaleidoscope Man is that sci-fi movie...I am now in my forties and have been a director and editor for over 20 years. I started in children’s television as an editor, cutting UK TV shows like; The Wombles, Astro Farm and Treasure Island. This gave me a fantastic grounding in visual story telling and how to actually put films together. Since then I directed the feature film, Written in Blood, and made a huge amount of short films and corporate productions. But my one true passion is still to make that epic sci-fi movie, and at last my dream project, Kaleidoscope Man, is ready to shoot.   It has taken me years to develop the script for Kaleidoscope Man and I have worked hard to find that “thing” that makes films magical - and it hasn't been simple. My first feature film, Written in Blood, was a tough film to make and could have done with another 6 months script development, so it has been vital that I get the script for Kaleidoscope Man perfect.KALEIDOSCOPE MAN - THE STORYAfter the death of his young daughter, THOMAS DUNN is a man who has lost his faith. His life has crumbled and his confidence is shattered. But on this day he wakes to discover that MANDY, his loving wife is finally pregnant again. Maybe this is their chance to move away from the tragedy of the past and for him to find his faith again. But on his way to his job as a doctor at a care centre for people with mental health problems, Tom has a horrific vision; fire, destruction and the end of the Earth. Unbeknown to Tom, Mandy, who is a teacher at a primary school, has had the same vision. As Tom arrives at the care centre, he discovers that three of his patients have also had the same vision; HARRIET, an angry lady with a narcissistic personality disorder,  FLOYD, a paranoid schizophrenic, and SAMANTHA, a goth and a manic depressive. Tom is baffled, why them?   Fear and paranoia sets in as people across the world discuss the visions that only some of them have experienced. Then, like an omen of doom, a new star appears in the heavens. As telescopes point skywards, the people of Earth finally learn that they are not alone in the universe. The star is a gigantic spaceship. Tom wants out of the city, as quickly as possible and tries to call Mandy, but the two of them miss each others phone calls. As the sun sets, a small venomous four legged harvester spaceship attacks the hospital and abducts Tom, Floyd, Harriet and Samantha. The harvester races upwards and takes them aboard the mother-ship which hovers above the Earth. Tom, Floyd, Harriet and Samantha are forced into pods and then put into each others deepest thoughts and fantasies. Here they discover the horrific truth as to the visions, why they were abducted and why THEY were chosen. The mother-ship launches a massive assault on the Earth, sending out millions of harvester craft to collect up the inhabitants of Earth, and put them in pods within the belly of the mother-ship.Tom discovers that he must look deep within himself to find not just his faith, but the wisdom and strength to save the human race, from the horrors that threaten them. And somehow, he must do this with the help of his three patients. But first, he must save Mandy and their unborn child, as together they hold the future of the human race. The battle lines are drawn and the final stance for Earth is about to begin... SOME BACK STORY ABOUT THE MOVIEI tried to get Kaleidoscope Man off the ground a few years ago but had difficulties securing the finance. A local funding body, Screen West Midlands, gave me a grant to shoot a pilot and get the fantastic concept art done.YOU CAN WATCH THE FULL PILOT HERE:SHOOTING LOCATIONSA large part of the film is set on Earth and will be shot in London, Birmingham and Coventry. I have done a lot of location scouting and have the interior and exterior shooting locations pretty well organised. There is a section set on an alien planet which we plan to shoot on the island of Lanzarote (see www.kaleidoscopeman.com/locations). This is a barren landscape which was covered in lava over 200 years ago and looks incredibly lunar like. A small group of us will go over there for around four days to shoot these scenes.CGI SPECIAL EFFECTSWhen we made the pilot, I worked with two highly skilled CGI animators, Dave Ledsom and Stuart Burnicott, with them and our concept artist, Matt Allsopp, we designed and built all of the CGI spaceship interiors and exteriors. The same team will come on board and complete the CGI for us on the final film.The special effects work should take around 6 to 9 months to complete.A chunk of the film will be shot against a green screen and for this we have access to a local, purpose built chroma-key shooting stage which we will hire for around two weeks.I will keep our Facebook page regularly updated with the films progress, including the special effects.THE CASTWe do not have the cast in place yet, so plan to cast the film early in 2013. Actors need shooting dates and when we have set a date, we have a casting director friend, who will help us to find our actors. We will ensure that we get very experienced, powerful actors, who are passionate about their craft and who are perfect for their character roles.CAMERA EQUIPMENTOver the years I have built up my own business making corporate and event videos. This has enabled me to build up some top end filming and editing equipment which will help to keep the production costs down, and to pretty much finish the film in house.  Here is my day job website: www.alphastarproductions.com   HOW WE PLAN TO USE YOUR MONEYIf this Kickstarter campaign is successful and we manage to raise the minimum of £60,000 I plan to shoot the film for £40,000 and get the special effects done with the other £20,000. My hope is that we can raise much much more.Everybody will be paid a basic wage to work on the film. The main shoot will take approximately 3 weeks and the special effects approximately 6 to 9 months.KALEIDOSCOPE MAN REWARDSCheck out the video below for more information about the rewards you will get for supporting Kaleidoscope Man:I have added the script as a perk, and the cost for this is basically to send out a signed hard copy. All I ask is that you please don’t put it on the internet, at least, not until the film is finished and is out in the big wide world. Thank you.WANT TO BE ABDUCTED BY ALIENS..?Check out the video below which shows the animation pre-vis for the alien abduction sequence. The numbered pods are 1st Class and the others (with windows) are 2nd class.

STREETFIGHTERZ WHEELIE MURICA|undefined|So as we said, after 15 years of chaos, we decided we want to travel across the western half of our awesome country and wheelie the whole way. We've traveled extensively across the eastern portion of the country, but for reasons to difficult to explain, we've never made it west. Not knowing how long the gears and motors in our bikes will last, we want to wheelie our way to the pacific ocean. And of course, bring you along for every turn in the trip. We promise not to use the VCR's and VHS tapes from our early days, we've upgraded over the years, but with a little help from KickStarter, we're excited about bringing you the experience in the best possible quality and sound available.We've dreamed about a trip like this for years, and thought what better way to give back to our friends and fans for the years of support than to give them a behind the scenes look of a life time. The ultimate end goal, is a documentary style DVD, with more action, wild times, and whatever else happens all packed together. The problem obviously comes with the expense of the RV Rental, lodging, gas, food, tickets, production, etc. If we can get these expenses covered, we'll be able to focused completely on the riding, filming, planning, coordination, and everything else. As always, we love the support more than you know and hope to wheelie into the sunset soon!

"Launch ""Romeo and Juliet in Yiddish"" in New York City"|failed|"""Romeo and Juliet in YIddish"" is an ambitious, colorful, complex feature dramedy shot on the RED. It is the first American feature film 55% in colloquial YIddish in 70 years. With a budget to date of 175K it has galvanized audiences in Berlin, where it won the Gerhardt Klein Audience Award, London, and New York where it played to sold out houses at Lincoln Center at the New York Jewish Film Festival. (Please see Press Links!) Now its slated for a REAL WEEK LONG RUN at the pinnacle of Eastern Seaboard culture: the NEW CINEMA COMPLEX OF THE FILM SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER, the David Rockwell designed   (he designs the Oscar sets!!!!!! ), Eleanor  Bunin Monroe Film Center  starting July 8th. Can you say ""Brass Ring""?? So, in June: the Opening film for the Montreal Festival of Yiddish Culture at the Segal Centre in Montreal,  then Bucharest, then the annual Yiddish hoe down in Krakow, then Lincoln Center, and Israel in the Fall in the Compeition at The Jewish Eye at Ashkelon, (city of Spuds, here we come!) Not bad! Additionally, ""Romeo"" has become a subject of study for noted Shakespearologist Dr. Mark Burnett, who has the following to say: 'Exhilarating, intricate and intelligent, Romeo and Juliet in Yiddish takes Shakespeare where he has rarely been before. Both an adaptation of Romeo and Juliet, and a coming-of-age story premised on an imagined performance of the Bard's most famous play, the film brilliantly transposes the conflict and romance of ancient tragedy to the Hasidic communities of New York. In so doing, the film revitalizes the tale of 'star-crossed lovers' while simultaneously hinting at the need for larger kinds of understanding in today's society. Delightfully multi-layered and self-conscious, this is a film responsive to the concerns of today, mixing, as it does, the pressures of tradition, the sounds of rhythms of popular culture, and the lures and energies of the modern city. An innovative and attuned Shakespeare for our times.  Professor Mark Thornton Burnett, Queen's University, Belfast, Northern Ireland, UK'Jim Hoberman's made it a ""Voice Choice"" http://www.villagevoice.com/2011-01-05/voice-choices/romeo-and-juliet-in-yiddish/#http://yiddish.forward.com/node/3436.

Climbing 4 Kidz|failed|We are wanting to bring the vision to reality as we hope that this film will inspire children to find their inner climber instead of staying on the couch in front of TV.  As we did with our children, this film will show all aspects of what climbing is or what it can be for a child. This film is mainly focused on our youth, (but will show adults alike, how fun Climbing can be) showing them what the climbing world can bring, where it may take them, the people they may meet along the way, and the proper use of gear. Seen as the film is being done for children we will not be focusing on only one element of climbing, this will be showing manying different types of climbing, including Bouldering, Lead, Top-Roping, and Rappelling.

Nurse Mare Foals: Born to Die|successful|"HOW TO HELPThis documentary will reveal the cruel secret that some in the various equine breeding industries don’t like to acknowledge or talk about: Every year during breeding season, hours-old, non-pedigreed foals are taken from their mothers, whose job is to be a nurse mare to a pedigree foal.This cycle continues, over and over. The foals with championship potential are nourished by nurse mare’s milk critical to the health and survival of a baby horse. But what happens to the non-pedigreed and discarded foals? Many are left to die. Victoria Goss and her small crew save about 150 foals during foaling season every January through June. Working directly with a few nurse mare farms in Southern Ohio and Kentucky, they pick up eight to ten foals at a time as soon as they get a phone call. Leaving at dawn with an empty horse trailer, they return in late afternoon with a new batch of hours-old foals ready to be cared for, nursed to health and readied for adoption. Victoria’s low 2 percent mortality rate astounds veterinarians. When the foals are stabilized, they are adopted by those qualified in equine care and housing. Some have become stars in their own right as therapy horses.In October 2010, I volunteered at Last Chance Corral in Athens, Ohio, to muck stalls and help stock hay into one of the three barns on the property. Little did I know nor understand what this horse rescue organization has done since 1991. When I fully grasped the plight of the nurse mare foals, I was still drop-jawed with questions. Telling this story about the heroic work performed by Last Chance Corral founder Victoria Goss has become my passion. I need your help. Without this Kickstarter, future work on this documentary is in jeopardy. But more importantly, creating awareness about the nurse mare foals will not be possible and more horses will die. Born to Die is currently just under 11-minutes in length (which became my master's project at Ohio University in 2012). It is my goal to create a 30-minute feature that expands the story to show the viability of these horses.All expenses have been out of pocket. It's what we do for the love of a story, right? Kickstarter funding will be used for documented expenses that have helped create the current story, which include equipment,  travel, transportation and meals to Athens, Ohio. Post-production editing is a large part of what is ahead. Also built into the funding are expenses for gifts, shipping and fees for Kickstarter (5%) and Amazon (3-5%). I hope you will join me in telling this important story. Let's create awareness and save lives. Thank you for any support you are able to give. REWARDS AND GIFTSSCREEN SAVER IMAGESResting foal at Last Chance Corral, Athens, OhioIn the foal barn at Last Chance Corral, Athens, Ohio.PRINTS DONATED FOR THIS KICKSTARTER PROJECTA heartfelt thank you to my photojournalist colleagues who have spent much of their careers documenting horses and equine lifestyles.

The Bird Nerd|successful|WE JUST HIT OVER £1000!!! Thanks to all who have donated!We all have a competitor at something we love, whether that be sports, video game leader boards or, for some, bird watching.Alan Argus has the dream of being the local bird watching legend, however: the cunning Bernie Samson currently sits at the throne. He's won Bird watcher of the month award eleven times in a row, and won't stop bragging that he's about to make it to twelve.And this weekend turns out to be primetime for bird watchers; Coco Cola's parrot mascot Coco, from the adverts on TV, has escaped and is on the loose.Determined now not to miss this opportunity, Alan packs his camera, binoculars and some warm clothes as he camps out all night, waiting for Coco.The Bird Nerd shows that no matter what you're passionate about, and whatever gets in your way there's always light at the end of the tunnel.The Bird Nerd is a short comedy film being made by 16-20 year olds from across the UK, all of whom have been handpicked by the National Film and Television School as the next generation of British Filmmakers.Our absolutely bare minimum budget for the film is just £400. Any excess money we raise will go toward hiring out more elaborate props and costumes, in order to give the film a sense of slightly hightened reality and hence greater production values. At the moment, the majority or our budget considers: a) hiring out some awesome locations in the Herefordshire countryside; b) hiring techincal equipment such as lights and grip equipment; c) transport for all of our amazing crew from across the UK to attend the shoot.Will (middle), our Director.

The Great Kentucky Goblin Spree|successful|You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.PlayReplay with soundPlay with  sound00:0000:00 Teaser TrailerOfficial Poster    The Great Kentucky Goblin Spree is inspired by true events and set in the backwoods of Kentucky in 1955. It's about two families, the patriarchs of which happen to be brothers, coming together for a low-key family reunion and in the process are besieged late in the night by visitors from a spacecraft that crash lands near the cabin on their property. Instead of hiding under their beds or heading for the hills like most normal people are prone to do, it becomes an all night standoff consisting of copious amounts of moonshine and gunfire.   We've reached the point in our project where we cannot proceed without funding. Due to our locations being limited (the majority of the film takes place on the property) we had the luxury of building the cabin interior set in a warehouse that was provided for us. The materials used were donated by Le Chat Noir, a local black box theatre, and were pieces of previously used sets from their past productions. Now that our interior scenes are complete it's time to move on to the exterior scenes. And that's gonna cost money.   First, we need an exterior set, and that's going to consist of a cabin. Since we have filmed our interior scenes and also plan on taking the majority of that set with us to the property (also donated to us) we only need to build the exterior of the house. But it will still be an expensive endeavor. We also have no electricity as we will be shooting in a remote location so generators will be needed to power the many lights needed. We also need a non-running early-1950's era truck and money for additional costumes. Up until this point I have fed the cast and crew out of my own pocket but I assume we will have longer shoots now that we're on location and additional meals will be a necessity.The Great Kentucky Goblin Spree T-ShirtYou can visit our official Facebook page here: https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Great-Kentucky-Goblin-Spree/1403873309851103 Like us!You can also learn more about Le Chat Noir here: http://www.lcnaugusta.com
Opening Portals DVD|failed|"We have found evidence that portals exist!In the spring months of 2011, UFO researcher Nigel Mortimer witnessed an extraordinary event - two military jets that were chasing a silvery ball of light over the woodlands of Settle in North Yorkshire, England. Shortly afterwards, he watched a ghost like owl appear out of nowhere, it sat staring at him with large dark eyes, within those same woods. He soon found out that other locals in the township had been observing these same lightships descending into the treetops for years. Intrigued by these sightings, Nigel began to explore the woodland with his wife Helen, but they initially found nothing unusual apart from the massive outcrop of rock known as Castleberg, which hung silently, looming over the small market town for thousands of years. More UFO sightings were reported and all of them seemed to be originating from the wooded craggy slopes of that place.Nigel came across an old painting and map of the Settle area which showed something unusual at Castleberg which was no longer there; a line of four massive ancient standing stones that ran down the hillside. His further investigations revealed that in the 1600's the British government mysteriously made an effort to remove these stones and replace them with something else on the landscape which would erase all living memory of the original Settle Sun Dial. Four hundred years later, Nigel Mortimer rediscovered where the secret sun dial had been placed, why it had been covered up, removed from the landscape and what its true purpose was - A PORTAL to another world!The secret that inter dimensional portals exist has been kept hidden away from the general public. The elite know that this is the preferred mode of transportation into our reality for the ET visitors. The amazing video and photographic evidence that has been gained by the Mortimer's at this portal site is groundbreaking! No longer can the truth be hidden.....ET Communication at the Sun Dial Portal WE NEED HELP TO BRING THIS TRUTH TO YOU!""A few months after the portal site was rediscovered,  I became very ill. I could not breath properly and all of my energy was zapped from my body. I was taken to hospital twice with these symptoms but no definite solution to my illness was found. I suffered that illness for two years. I thought I was going to die.... I did not tell the doctors that I had been cursed with this illness from a negative human spirit from the 1600's at the portal!""  Even though there had been many setbacks like this throughout 2011 to 2013, which included personal attacks by the local council, my self funded book on the portal being banned from all shops and libraries in the locality, and further psychic warnings, my wife and I continue to search for the truth. The illness has caused me to be unfit for physical work and so we have struggled on little income during this time, but even so, we have continued to work at the portal and spread the word about the amazing things we have discovered there. Much of this documented video evidence will make up part of the whole story behind the documentary we will produce. In essence, we have already captured the heart of this story.Now we need more funds to finish shooting and editing the rest of this film during 2014, so that we can get it out into the world! It is so important that we do this soon - we understand now, that there are none human life forms which exist,  that depend on this truth and They have been waiting a very long time to be invited into this physical realm!The Sun Dial that never was! ONE MORE UFO DOCUMENTARY...HOW WILL THIS ONE BE DIFFERENT? When we said that this documentary will be groundbreaking, they were not empty words. There has never been a ground roots film like this one, which gives both an accurate account of the history behind the cover up of a real portal, but also goes on to describe with amazingly detailed evidence that portals like the one found at Settle are still being used by inter dimensional Beings. Many of them are like us, some of them rather stranger lifeforms. Nigel Mortimer is no New Age weirdo, he has 30 years of UFO investigations and research under his belt and what happened to him at Settle was a shock to him!  The extraordinary synchronicity of separate witnesses  accounts from the portal site is only the tip of the iceberg. This will not be a typical UFO documentary. This film will show how history and science often converge into the phenomenal worlds of the paranormal. After viewing this film, science will not be able to simply ignore the truth. We hope that science will embrace it. The Mortimer's know what happened and aren't waiting for anyone to prove it to them. They have the evidence. More extraordinary than the evidence is the effect the whole experience has had on all of our lives and the impact it will have on the immediate future of humankind. Nigel confronts negative energies at the portal... Photographic Evidence from the portal can be viewed here:   https://plus.google.com/photos/112863780699861612176/albums/5928410803933528545?authkey=CMaJidueosTEFgNigel's Book about the Portals coming soon...."
Piero Marsili|failed|Piero Marsili Libelli A look through and behind his lensTo see is to make a change, and whose pictures have the power to change the way we see.Marsili began his career in the seventies in Milan working with the BBC photographing crime. He later moved toRome, where he started working with L'Espresso (An Italian weekly news magazine. It is one of the two most prominent Italian weeklies, the other being Panorama) He then began to travel, reporting across Africa, India, Japan and  Pakistan as well as dealing with some of the great directors from the avant-garde theatre, such as Michelangelo Antonioni, Francesco Rosi, Giuliano Montaldo, Marco Ferreri and most recently Vittorio Storaro to film Caravaggio.The documentary will be composed of four different shooting styles, two of which we will re-create and two  which will be more natural and real. I would like to document a week with Piero and life as he perceives it. The film will be surreal like one aspect of his art, and the interviews composed of dialogues taking place in both normal and extraordinary situations.1.An introduction to Italian magical realism and how it’s done. The photographer on set, his interaction with the  subjects, the first glimpse into his mind, and to end a staged interview where he tells us past stories about his sets. 2. War, Piero tells us about his experience. With the use of sounds we will in building up a momentum for this, Piero’s mind drifts. Him in any given situation (drinking a coffee, walking in the street, etc) his eyes fixed on something, camera movement will always be the same or similar - a long far away take that moves around crowded spaces to end with the photographer. When the shot ends, we will have the continuation of narration and war photos will enter the frame.3. His inspiration. Piero and what inspires him - we will film short clips of two to fifteen seconds, in multiple locations around Puglia. A day or more driving around everywhere looking for places, Piero taking photos, finding amazing locations, creating beautiful compositions and seeing the man work for a photo that is not staged.  4. On and off the stage. Stories of him photographing in theatre, movie sets, and on set in general. Piero in real life: from him cooking, to him having breathing problems due to his smoking habit. Him and his wife spending time together at home, going through photos on his computer. His framed photos, the house they live in, the light hitting the pictures hanging throughout the house, him walking between roomsEstimated duration between around 10 - 12 minutesThe short documentary will create awareness of Marsili. 
LEGO Imagination Lab|failed|"""Too many people grow up. That's the real trouble with the world, too many people grow up. They forget. They don't remember what it's like to be 12 years old...""-Walt DisneyI think we can all agree that as children (and maybe currently) our imagination worked at its best when we brought our toys to life. I want to capture this dream, and use my skills to bring our toys alive in the best ways possible. Join me as I share stories and values with some of the world's favorite toys. Your backing will help me complete five, five minute stop action Lego videos. These videos will be distributed for free to Lego Builder's Clubs in elementary school's around the nation. Currently, my thirty second videos are being shown in the University Place School District in Washington State. But with your funding, I can make longer, better quality videos, that I can send to teachers in at least five different states. Your help will get the momentum started. I aim to inspire the youth, and adults, of this age. And you can join the magic! Your money will specifically aid me in acquiring: better camera lenses $200-600             - The quality of the camera lens directly effects the production quality of the video. I believe my value comes from the story, but also and equally from the sharpness and composition of the images.  The software (DragonFrame) $295            - This is the software I currently use, however I can only afford the free 30 day trial, which is vastly limiting. When the month is over, I loose the ability to create my videos at their current quality. By owning this software, I can make videos longer than thirty seconds (my 5 minute goal) and as time progresses, I can explore creating vastly longer adventures!Recording Microphone $150          - In my videos, I wish to insert dialogue and music. The microphone will record different actor's voices. To avoid copyright conflicts, I will also record original music for the videos. For this price, I can purchase a zoom recorder with the ability to record everything at studio quality. Adobe Creative Cloud Suite $30/month         - Adobe Creative Cloud gives me vast and endless resources. I currently use Adobe Premiere software to edit the videos, and make use of After Effects, Photoshop, Lightroom, and Muse. It also gives me a domain name for my own web page. Without this powerful tool, making these videos would be pointless. Materials (Clay, lights, tripods, props)         - Each set is made in intricate detail with modeling clay, lighting, and Legos or any other appropriate material for a compelling scene. Your backing will provide me with a flexible budget to create immersing worlds for each video.and most importantly, LEGO sets!           - Of course, I need the Legos to make the movies!!! These don't have to be purchased new. I accept donated Legos. I also plan to purchase second hand Legos. In our education system, I firmly believe the encouragement to imagine is lacking. Too many children are pushed through the system, loosing touch with their dreams as a child. Those dreams were what made us happiest, and those dreams should never be suppressed. Get back in touch with your inspirations and dreams, and help me inspire others. Dreaming is a dangerous thing, because it can better the world in infinite ways. Never stop being a kid. Never stop playing. "

We still need some visual effects to achieve specific looks and style that we want. Beyond that, our goal is to get the movie in as many festivals as possible but that is, unfortunately, a costly venture. Although, some festivals are free, many festival fees (especially ""top tier"" ones) can cost anywhere from $20-$80, plus requiring media and promotional materials.

At Home in Maine: A Film Series About Homebirth and Midwives|failed|"On December 27, 2004 I had a homebirth with my son in rural Montville, Maine assisted by two Certified Professional Midwives. The portraitremains vivid.  The windowpanes frosted, a waning full moon shiningthrough.  Candles and Christmas tree lightsilluminate the room like a temple.  The birthing tub next to the Christmastree.  The woodstove nearly red with heat.  The only sounds:  my moansand roars, urges I could never supress.  My midwife breathing beside me,holding the space.  That last push—the one I thought would never come—myson emerging from my body, into the water and into his father’s waitinghands.  Two births.  My son. And me, as a Mother. My birth experience completely transformed and empowered me.  I began to care about the world a whole lot more.  I came to recognize that most women in the US did not have this kind of birth experience I did.  Why is this?  Highly medicalized birth, with a dangerously high rate of intervention, including a rate of C-section hovering at around 33%.  Also, persistent marginalization and misrepresentation in the mainstream media around birth (and homebirth) with the message:  birth is a crisis, birth must be feared, birth hurts, birth must happen in the hospital.I am filmmaker.  I felt compelled to create a film that would challenge these assumptions, that would provide a picture of how birth can be, that would give women and their partners more information about the choice to have a homebirth.Four years later, there are eleven films.  The fruit of this labor is ""At Home in Maine"", an online documentary film series about homebirth and midwifery care.  The films present authentic, intimate, artistic portraits of the homebirth experience.  They are meant to educate and inform, challenge the myths--and inspire.  All the films are accessible online:  www.mainehomebirth.wordpress.com  ""At Home in Maine"" is part of a vibrant grassroots Natural Birth Movement that seeks to transform the way the US sees birth.  Does birth.I aim to keep adding to the ""At Home in Maine"" series, to expand this growing body of work--to show that homebirth happens.  That means more families, more midwives and more locations.  To show that homebirth is a safe and viable choice for women and their families.  That it is normal.  The funding from this successful Kickstarter campaign will be used to create four more films for the ""At Home in Maine"" series.  Funds will cover production (mileage, equipment costs, supplies, time) and post-production expenses (editing and output).  By the summer of 2012, I hope to increase the number of films in the series to fifteen.  I am already in production on the next homebirth film--with a mother who gave birth at home earlier this month--and have several other families interested in participating in this project.  ""At Home in Maine"" is not just for Mainers!  The film series has attracted a global audience that extends well-beyond Maine's borders, with viewers from countries as far-flung as Russia, Iraq and Indonesia.  There's no place like home! And ""At Home in Maine"" is not just about homebirth.  It's for anyone who wants a picture of normal, natural, woman-centered birth.  Images have the power to change the way we see the world.  The way we see and do birth.Since my homebirth experience, I havebeen spellbound, transfixed, held in the sway of the transformativepower of it all:  of birth, humancapacity and magic.  My own birth was not recorded, yet, I play the sequenceagain and again in my memory.  Itcalms me on a fitful night of sleep. I create films about homebirth to preserve that experience, to acknowledgethe beauty and spirituality, to show what is possible, to witness that beautyand magic over and over again.  I film to love women and our bodies, toshow birth as creation; to see birth as art.Thank you for your support of this project!"

Lego Batman: Zombie Genesis Series|successful|The General Idea.I would like for this Batman Zombie animation to spawn a successful online series. I have almost graduated university and it would be good to get something going online that was my own creation. Both Batman and Zombies are very popular themes online at the moment, especially in the lego universe.£200 Total Goal Stretch.I can't believe how fast you all helped me reach my goal! I can now afford to create the full hospital set for the first series that I designed myself. Not only this but I can have more characters, not only more but higher quality, this is fantastic!Unfortunately I had some bad luck with my camera lens and it is now slightly damaged. I can still make the series, I was filming just before I wrote this update. Basically there is a big blue mark appearing in the center of images every time I take a picture. My work around for this is that I can film from more of a distance then just crop the footage in post production, the camera I am using is an amazing piece of equipment, so the image resolution is fine to do this without loosing any quality.I am worried the damage could get worse, as it is basically an issue that has grown(this was a second hand lens to begin with). If I can raise the extra funds I will use them to purchase another lens for the camera which will make filming so much more easy.Examples of my work.Before I get into details, here are two examples of my work so far with Lego. The first video took a single day to make and the second only took 4 or 5 days. What Will Your Funding Go To?The funds will be used simply to purchase the required bits and pieces for the film. Example given, a batman lego figure costs around £8. I already have my own camera and equipment to make the film so that's not a problem. I also fully own all the software that is needed. I have enough things to make episode 1 but after that I will hit a brick wall so to speak.Further DetailsThe episodes would be about 150 seconds in length each and special characters from the dc universe would be featured throughout the series. The first series as a test run for popularity would run for 5 episodes.The general outline of the whole thing has been scripted and planned.I actually already have the parts to make episode one. Its more of the series that I will need support to develop until it grows in popularity.I made a Youtube channel only a week ago and already have over 200 subs, so the videos are spreading quite fast for a new youtuber! Would be great to get a new memorable project out there.
Digitizing My Family|successful|I love my family. They have shaped who I am, and each one of them holds a hint of who I will become. I'm so lucky to live in a time when I have more than memories, more than words... I have old videos and film.Every VHS tape, every foot of 8mm film, is an opportunity to discover ourselves. Why we are who we are. I'm in the process of digitizing my family's history - Specifically the pile of VHS and Hi8 tapes we have (over 50 in all!). More exciting, my grandfather and his brother, an avid videographer back in the day, filmed a large collection of 8mm videos that I currently have in my possession.Once these films and videos are digitized, I will be putting together short films. Little windows into our family. Short documentaries featuring interviews with different family members. Films that explore facets of my life. These films will be available for all to see online.To digitize and preserve these films properly requires expensive equipment and a professional hand, and will take up a bulk of the fund goal. Here is a partial list of what is needed to truly begin this project in earnest.- Digitize and archive over 3,000 feet of 8mm films- Acquire the hardware needed to digitize and preserve the VHS and Hi8 Tapes- Purchase hard drives for storage and archiving- Acquire additional software for proper treatment of the videos- Outsource transcription/translation services- Purchase blu-rays or digital tapes for archivingThis project has been weighing on my heart heavily since I was young. It has been difficult to raise funds on my own because of the sheer expense of hard drive space; special hardware needed to digitize the tapes; software to edit; and other odds and ends.

Lei|successful|Hi, my name's Georgia, the Writer and Director of Lei.Lei is a film inspired by my experiences going home after two years at University. Reconnecting with old friends I realised exactly how far apart a lot of us had grown in such a short time. It led me to explore what would happen to people who grew up in a very small, claustrophobic town and then suddenly left, only to be reunited at a friend's funeral. For these reasons the film holds a very personal theme for me and is one I am incredibly excited to be making. I am hugely inspired by directors like Steve McQueen and Terrance Malick, i believe they make incredible films about simple stories but they do them so so well. I plan to make a visually and emotionally arresting film. I love natural lighting, i love nature and wide open spaces and icant wait to show off the English coast! We are now mostly cast and are on a 9th draft of the script! The project is really beginning to take off and we just need your help to complete it to the best of our abilities! I have very high hopes for this film and really believe that it can be a festival screening piece, we just need the ability to make it!Music in Video (thanks!): TITLE: Wings ARTIST: NICOLAI HEIDLASYour Funding.Your funding is so important to us. The project is ambitious but has real potential to be a beautiful piece of story telling, if allowed the right tools. One of these is the actors, the people who carry the story and in an ensemble piece like this are incredibly important to get right. We want to use the funding to draw in the best people we can. The other thing we need help with is the cost of travelling to the stunning locations near by. We understand the compromises between a stunning location and where we can get to but, with your help, you will allow us to access more beautiful places.It will also allow us to particpate in film festivals, and get our work out there to new people as i feel the film has real potential!We are dedicated, professional and determined to make an award winning film about themes I believe in.

Peripheral vision - short film|successful|We're making our final film for our final year of university. The film is set in 2020 in Sydney, Australia, a time when a curfew has been placed on women so that they can't walk the streets alone at night. Our protagonist, an influential media personality who is strongly against the curfew is attacked in her own home by a man who wants to limit her voice and power. The genre is a drama/thriller. We hope that our film makes a strong comment on the way that victim blaming is so prevalent in today's society, and it cannot be tolerated. We are in need of some extra money in order to get some quality equipment to film with, buy props, get make-up artists, feed the cast and crew and so on. Any donations would make so much difference!
STAGNANT POOL enters post-production|successful|You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.PlayReplay with soundPlay with  sound00:0000:00!! Version Française sous l'anglais !!ABOUT THE DIRECTOR On the set of Stagnant PoolAfter premiering my collaborations (POLET, LE CYCLE) with creative agency TRUSST exclusively on DAZED DIGITAL in 2009, I have continued to explore the body, identity and sexuality in a series of personal experimental shorts. Stagnant Pool explores a series of new themes explained below.I have also gone on to creating commercial work for international brands such as ALDO, L'OREAL, SSENSE, DIESEL, BIOTERM & SID LEE.My work has been screened in various festivals including in Paris, Milan, London, Amsterdam, Lisbon and Brussels, Toronto and Montreal.Nico Archambault stars as NarcissusThe film's star, dancer and choreographer Nico Archambault was the first performer to win So You Think You Can Dance Canada and has gone on to dance for Janet Jackson amongst others, star in several feature length movies and produce his own television show on Radio Canada.INSPIRATIONIt was during my time in university, studying Communications, that I became interested in behavioral shifts resulting from new technologies. While writing a paper about the impact of social media on human interaction, I stumbled upon a book by Twenge and Campbell, where they cite statistics showing that diagnosis for Narcissistic Personality Disorder has tripled within the last decade. They associated this increase to the rise of social media whose interface/structure imposes a focus on ones self.--C’est pendant mes études universitaires en Communications que j’ai commencé à m’intéresser aux changements de comportement des gens résultant des nouvelles technologies.En rédigeant un travail sur l’impact des médias sociaux sur les interactions humaines quotidiennes, je suis tombé sur un livre de Twenge et Campbell où l’on mentionnait que le Trouble de la personnalité narcissique avait triplé dans la dernière décennie. Les auteurs associaient cette augmentation à l’émergence des médias sociaux, dont la structure et l’interface sont très centrées sur l’image personnelle.THE FILM/ LE FILMReading up on the symptoms of NPD, it occurred to me that the myth of Narcissus would be interesting adapting into a dance film. Reinterpreting a familiar tale was a great exercise for exploring linear storytelling through my signature aesthetic, something I had never done before.  Rather than purely making a film about dance in a location other than the stage, I wanted to take full advantage of the medium and have the dance come in at the climax of a storyline. The overall tone of the film will be very theatrical and moody. It takes an even more surreal turn after Narcissus falls under the spell of his own reflection.A lot of the choreography references the psychological profile of a person with NPD. Certain elements of the original fable were modified to make parallels to today's current trends in social media. --Le fait de réinterpréter une histoire familière a été une opportunité pour moi d’explorer une forme narrative plus linéaire tout en conservant mon esthétique personnelle, chose que je n’avais jamais faite auparavant.Au lieu de simplement faire un film sur la danse dans un contexte autre que la scène, j’ai voulu prendre pleinement avantage du médium et insérer la danse au point culminant du scénario. L’ambiance du film sera très théâtrale et riche en émotions. L’histoire prend un tournant encore plus surréaliste lorsque Narcisse tombe sous le sort de son propre reflet.Une partie importante de la chorégraphie fait référence au profil psychologique d’une personne souffrant du TPN. De plus, certains éléments du mythe de Narcisse ont été modifiés afin de faire des parallèles avec les tendances actuelles dans les médias sociaux.LOCATION + ART DIRECTION// LIEU DE TOURNAGE + DIRECTION ARTISTIQUE The film was shot in the alien landscapes of Quarry Island within the Mingan Archipelago near Havre St. Pierre in Quebec and features Archambault starring alongside four dancers and choreography by Street Parade. Costumes were designed by Montreal-based designer Duy and Travis Taddeo.--Le film fût tourné dans le paysage étrange de l’Île de Quarry de l’archipel Mingan, près de Havre-Saint-Pierre. Il met en vedette Nico Archambault accompagné de quatre danseurs, chorégraphiés par Street Parade. Les costumes ont été confectionnés par les designers montréalais Duy et Travis Taddeo. BUDGET BREAKDOWN / BUDGET DÉTAILLÉI was lucky to get a grant from the CALQ for 7000$.  An extra 6000$ were required to shoot the film on location. We estimate to complete the film with a final 7500$.Due to the harsh weather conditions on the last day of shooting, an important scene must be re-shot. Luckily, the shot can be recreated in studio. The money raised here will go towards the one day re-shoot, the completion of sound design and score and some special effects required in the script--J’ai eu la chance de recevoir une bourse de 7000$ du CALQ pour ce projet. Il a fallu 6000$ de plus pour aller tourner à l’Île de Quarry, et j’estime qu’il faudra 7500$ supplémentaires pour compléter le film.À cause de conditions météorologiques difficiles lors de la dernière journée de tournage, une scène importante n’a pu être tournée. L’argent amassé sera investi dans la complétion de cette dernière scène en studio, les touches finales sur la trame sonore et l’ajout de quelques effets spéciaux nécessaires. WHAT WE WOULD DO WITH 10 000$CE QUE NOUS FERIONS AVEC 10 000$The low water temperature on location were deemed to dangerous to shoot in so we had to cut them out of the script. With more money we could schedule another day of reshoot at an indoor pool!--La basse temperature de l'eau amenait un trop grand risque d'hypotermie pour les scènes sous l'eau donc la scène a été cancellée. En amassant 10 000$, nous pourrions la filmer dans une piscine intérieure!RELEASE / SORTIE DU FILMIt is our intention and goal to have it  premiere at Cannes.--Notre intention est de sortir le film en première à Cannes.LENGHT/DURÉEWe estimate the final cut to be around 12 minutes long.--La version finale du film durera approximativement 12 minutes.

Rocky Horror Saved My Life - A Fan Documentary|successful|"(VIDEO SLIGHTLY NSFW)“The Rocky Horror Picture Show” is the longest-running theatrical release in film history.  Since its debut in 1975, it has become the very definition of ""cult movie.""  However, if you’ve ever been to a live performance of Rocky Horror, you know that the film is only one part of a very unique midnight movie experience.  ""Rocky Horror Saved My Life"" is not a documentary about the people who made this legendary movie, though.  It's about the fans who have devoted their lives to preserving it.For almost 40 years, people from all walks of life have ""given themselves over to absolute pleasure"" by performing live on the stages, aisles, and seats of cinemas showing ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show.""  From the first time Louis Farese yelled ‘Buy an umbrella, you cheap bitch!’ in the audience at the Waverly in NYC, to the innovations that have brought Rocky Horror “audience participation” into the 21st Century, we'll examine the origins and traditions of this truly unique cinematic phenomenon from the perspective of the people who sacrificed so much to keep it alive.  Throughout 2014, our crew will travel to cities all over the US, and possibly all over the world, to document the history of Rocky Horror’s avid collectors, live performers, and devoted fans.Given our experience, and the resources at our disposal, we feel quite confident that we can make one hell of a documentary, even on a fairly tight budget.

FILM PROJECT:  A HISTORY OF COMING OUT|failed|The Pye Harris Project is a non-profit made from funds from the estates of Robert Harris and Ed Pye, life partners for over 60 years.  Upon Mr. Pye's death in 2012, funds he left in his will went into the creation of a series of films to teach young people about LGBT history through the stories of those who lived during different eras.  The first two films have been completed (Coming Out in the 1950s and Coming Out in the 1960s) and can be seen on YouTube.  The third and fourth films (Coming Out in the 1970s, and Coming Out in the Age of AIDS) are currently in production.We are looking for funds to edit the four short documentaries into one longer piece that can be offered to film festivals, schools and public television stations that gives a large broad overview of LGBT history.  The funds will be used to obtain additional archival footage, re-edit the existing films, and pay for publicity and future distribution.
No Man Is An Island|successful|"Why No Man is an Island?Stories like this come along once in a generation. And the story behind our proposed film is perhaps one of the greatest of the generation of our parents and grandparents who valiantly fought tyranny and oppression during the hard years of the Second World War in Greece.But ours isn't one of resistance, sabotage and bombs and bullets-- against the occupier. No Man is an Island is a story of soft power-- the victory of humanity over hatred; and, compassion over cruelty.Our short film will tell the story-- the survival story that is unique in all of Europe-- of the only Jewish community that didn't lose a single soul during the Holocaust. It is a story of heroism that needs to be told-- not only for future generations, but for the current one.International InterestThe project and the story of the Jews of Zakynthos have already generated international attention and media publicity in Greece, the United States, Canada, Mexico and beyond in major newspapers and media outlets. The story was even the topic of conversation between the Prime Ministers of Greece and Israel recently when the two met. We have also been featured in:Shalom Life, Canada's largest online Jewish publicationKathimerini, one of Greece's top daily newspapersMeet the TeamProducersFor producer Gregory Pappas, Zakynthos is personal. After hearing the survival story from his Cretan father as a teenager, Greg first uncovered testimony about Zakynthos while studying at the American College of Greece in Athens. He's dreamed of making a film ever since.In the last two years, Greg has produced two Cannes Short Film Corner films (Foreigner, Dichotomous), a feature-length personal documentary (Hello Anatolia), and a soon-to-be-released short starring Olympia Dukakis. With co-producer and DP Steven Priovolos, he recently circumnavigated the globe for a new TV series featuring adventure-seeker and kindness-champion Leon Logothetis.When he’s not producing films, Greg runs the Greek America Foundation, heads an event-planning firm called the Pappas Media Group, and writes for the Huffington Post. He also speaks regularly about Greece’s role during World War II, an era he has studied and researched extensively.We’re thrilled that No Man Is an Island has also attracted the support of the former president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Sid Ganis. As an Executive Producer, Ganis will lend advice and support on how to overcome the challenges of shooting a complex period film in a foreign country.Producers Gregory Pappas and Steven Priovolos, with Executive Producer Sid GanisDirectorRaised in Venezuela, director Joel Novoa is passionate about films that both entertain and convey a social-political message. Which is why NO MAN IS AN ISLAND felt like a perfect fit for Variety Magazine's rising Latin-American star.A recent graduate of the American Film Institute, Joel just completed his debut feature, “ESCLAVO DE DIOS” (“GOD’S SLAVE”), inspired by the 1994 bombing of the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association.Joel has worked on shorts and features in places like Venezuela, Argentina, Spain, Uruguay, Los Angeles, and Israel. His films have been recognized with selections and honors at more than 30 film festivals worldwide, including Cannes and the Los Angeles Shorts Fest.Director of Photography Award-winning cinematographer Steven Priovolos has signed on to shoot the film, in addition to his contribution as a producer. Born in Athens, Steven has worked on commercials, short films, and feature projects throughout the world, including the Greek features 180 Degrees and Kiss of Life. Have a closer look at Steven’s work here: http://www.stevendp.comScreenwriterAlready called a ""masterpiece"" by some of the top names in Hollywood who have read it, the script was penned by British screenwriter Mia Christou. Mia has worked professionally as a published author, writer, producer and actress.  Her background in theatre includes a Bachelor of Arts in Drama and English.  Recently, her feature script Lines in the Sand attracted the attention of Kennedy/Marshall and Sam Mendes, among others.Production DesignerTwo-time Art Director’s Guild nominee Giles Masters will be handling production design duties. Recognized for his art directing work in The Da Vinci Code, the Mummy franchise, and Tomorrow Never Dies, Giles brings over thirty years of experience to our short film.Concept art from another of Giles' WWII projectsSet PhotographerBorn in Tel Aviv, Roy Schweiger  is an accomplished fashion photographer whose work has been showcased in Milan, Cannes, and his home city. He has also served as an in house backstage photographer for DSQUARED2 since 2007.In addition to volunteering his time as a set photographer, Roy has painstakingly researched, located, and met with Greek Jewish survivors from Zakynthos.  His photographs speak to an eye for turning any location into his own stage.Jewish Zakynthos survivors located and photographed by Roy SchweigerLocation, Location, LocationThe true story behind No Man Is an Island played out on Zakynthos in the Ionian Sea. We plan to shoot some of the film on location in Zakynthos. In light of a 1953 earthquake that destroyed most of the World War II-era architecture on the island, we’ve identified the city of Chania in Crete as a primary stand-in for key Zakynthos exteriors. Since Greg's family is from Chania, our film will have plenty of local support.The 15th century synagogue of Etz Hayim on Crete matches period architecture on Zakynthos.BudgetOur budget is more than $165,000 to shoot the short film in Greece and ultimately submit it to festivals throughout the world. We have already raised half of this budget from major donors from a community of people around the world, like you! This Kickstarter campaign is designed to raise $25,000 and build a bigger army of support for this project.  In Conclusion!Our message is timeless.  No Man is an Island will share the largely unknown and untold story of how two men and 35,000 citizens of a Greek Island stood on the side of goodness and humanity when they stared evil in the face.No Man is an Island is a film that must be made. It is a story that must be told. With your help, this can become a reality.Remember-- your support is tax-deductible. The Greek America Foundation is a non-profit organization.We thank for your support and cannot wait to start shooting in 2014.Sincerely,Gregory Pappas & Steven Priovolos ProducersPS: We are also grateful for the support we've received from our friends for other projects.

Borders|failed|In collaboration with University of The West of England.MARE'S BEDROOM. NIGHT MARE, 30, is sitting on her bed, writing in her diary during the night. She leans back on her pillow,hesitates, and then scribbles vigorously with her pen. Little does she know that this will be the last entry shewrites, which will pass on through future generations: - Out there everything is full of borders; we are all travellers between the lines. The ones who draw the linesare the only ones who do not live between them.DIRECTOR’S CREATIVE STATEMENTOur project looks at migrants’ stories from a different perspective. Desperate people coming to Europe are demonised at worst and patronised at best. We want to switch the perspective, to show these ordinary peoplewho’ve lived through extraordinary circumstances as heroes instead of victims. This project is a tribute to all the ‘normal’ people who struggle to live a life with dignity; who fight to control their own destiny and don’t surrender to the manipulative games that these invisible authorities play when they manufacture emotions to control the dynamic of the world. They are my heroes, and I aim to portray them as such in this project.  The journey of our main characters, an eight-year-old girl, LLUITA and her father PARE, who flee the Middle East after her mother is murdered and the consequences of this journey and separation.The audience accompanies our characters on their difficult journey, witnessing the trials they face and sharing their fear and worry, before switching roles to suddenly become their attacker, heckling them from a theatre stage. Our experience of LLUITA and her father’s frightening journey reflects our experience of the many refugees seeking out a safe place to be: it’s easy to be sympathetic for people while they are at a safe distance from us, but once they reach our shores and threaten our cosy, comfortable lifestyles with their presence our attitude can quickly change. This scene challenges us and makes the audience reflect on our darker side. Jumping to the future, the film joins LLUITA as a woman in her 30s. Who has she become after this long journey from her hometown to cross the border into Europe? The same person on both sides of the line; the same person, and with the same enemies, just in different masks. The film aims to make audience reflect and question their own prejudices and open questions in their minds. Is it possible to escape a predestined fate?CREWMaria Tomas - Scriptwriter/Directorhttps://youtu.be/gxkSFIZi-5AMy passion for storytelling started when I was very young through the literature; writing poetry, theatre plays and narratives . Since then, I have always been looking for new creative ways to tell stories; that is what brought me in first instance to theatre as an actress, writer and director, collaborating with independent projects and working on my own productions, which as led to my further interest in the film world, writing, directing and editing my personal work in the University of West of England where I am currently studying Filmmaking.  Writing together with my interest in drawing and painting, makes media my favourite medium to combine and keep developing all my passions; keep learning, keep experimenting, always trying to go further in storytelling, because to me, no matter what medium of expression is used, it is about telling stories. Borders is my last year project at University which I have written, produced and directed. I believe, together with my talented team, Borders can become  a great short film with a remarkable story and a striking stylistic approach.Alex Waeland - Script EditorI have always enjoyed creative writing, and a good story, and since studying filmmaking at UWE Bristol, I have been developing my screenwriting skills and creative story-telling abilities to a more accomplished level. I have been applying these skills to my own work and offering advice to others too.I became interested in Borders when the story was pitched to me in its early development. Since then I have worked with the director and helped transform it into a well-researched and engaging script, which I am eager  to see transferred to the screen.Sergjes Bozoks - Director of PhotographyMy very first scar I got at the age of 5 because I tried to reach for a camera on a shelf to take a surprise photo of my family. That night ended in the hospital. Never the less, my passion for cameras and images did not go away. I have dedicated years of my life to explore and learn more about how light works and how with the help of different lenses and different cameras one can achieve desired emotional impact on the viewer. I have worked with the director, Maria Tomas, of the film on several projects. We like each other’s style of work and we have developed a short hand communication and understanding.  My Moto is: If film were all about the story I would quit image making now and move onto radio plays. There is enormous potential to enhance the story through visual means.Kahlen Chan - SoundI have finished my Associate Degree in Creative and Interactive Media at City University from 2012 to 2014. I am currently a degree student from University of West of England, Bristol, furthering my study in filmmaking and Creative Media. I specialised in sound.I keen on the sound edit work, so I choose sound as my specialism during my study and I will be the sound recordist and sound editor in this project. Sound work is one of the most important elements in creative industries, it is the easiest platform for creator to express their idea and engage their feeling to the audience. Georgina Freir - Production DesignerHi my names Georgina and I am the production designer for this project. I have a background in games development which I would say heavily influences how I go about my work. My inspirations are Eulyn C Womble and Katia St.           CASTZaida Alonso - LluitaZaida has performed in several short films, some of them internationally awarded.

Annulus: Ring of Light|failed|"What is Annulus: Ring of Light?A dream began in the fall of 2002. As he sat in his high school science class, Christopher Barry learned of a solar eclipse to happen in May 2012. Now, his longtime dream to witness this celestial phenomenon is coming to a head.Annulus: Ring of Light is a documentary/photobook of the journey he and photographer/videographer Erik Judson take from Anchorage, Alaska to Lunar Crater National Natural Monument in Nevada.Home to one of the darkest night skies in the country, the site has been described as so dark, ""the Milky Way casts a shadow,"" by one observer. Using this unique location, Erik will chronicle the  journey he and Christopher take to reach a partial (annular) eclipse on May 20. Afterwards, he will use the opportunity to take once-in-a-lifetime photographs of the night sky.A combined astrophotography/documentary project, Annulus will tell the story of this journey through video, time lapse, and photography throughout.What am I funding?This funding will allow me to purchase a full spectrum infrared/ultraviolet conversion for one of my cameras, a still/video dslr to shoot updates, and a wide-aperture lens for better astrophotography.What can I expect from the documentary?With a large array of cameras available to both the both of us, we will use a combination of digital, traditional (film-based), and time lapse photography.Combined with the real-time footage of interviews and our own interactions, the documentary will compile the time-lapse videos of our drive to and from the site, the solar eclipse, and the night sky for a couple nights following the eclipse.The documentary is expected to run approximately 45 minutes-1 hour. What about the photo book?With the sheer number of photos to be taken (approximately 10 rolls of film), multiple medium- and large-format photographs, and the digital cameras, I will select the best photographs I can find, and create a book from them.It will be hardcover and at least 30 photographs will be included.Who is involved in this project?Erik Judson is a Journalism and Public Communications Major at the University of Alaska Anchorage. With an emphasis in media production, he will work to tell the story of the eclipse in a visually appealing way.Christopher Barry is a Photography Major at the University of Alaska Anchorage. Specializing in film cameras of all kinds (35mm, medium format, and large format [4""x5""]), Chris will be attempting to create large scale prints for his own uses.REMEMBER: Kickstarter is an all-or-nothing fundraising source!

"CLICK HERE TO CHECKOUT YOUR SPECIFIC INDUSTRY IN OUR UPDATES SECTIONMaster Keys Pro (MKP) is a necessary innovation for any software for music production, DJing, game/graphic/web design, software programming, CAD, video editing, animation, gaming, simulators, data entry, basic home use and any other software by adults or children with any level of computer knowledge and skill. It brings huge advantages to any computer user in any industry or just at home. MKP is the most powerful multifunctional touch screen keyboard available. It has limitless functions for any music, gaming, creative, CAD, design software or home use on PC/Apple for right handed/left handed users. MKP replaces your standard keyboard/mouse with the MKP touch screen technology which allows you to work in new/more advanced ways and gives you a superior generation of computer interface. Although MKP keeps all of the current functions of a keyboard, it adds a huge amount of new options for you and it is far faster and easier to use for you every day in a more productive way. For those of you who use music, game/graphic/web design, CAD, video editing, animation, software programming, simulators and games software especially have many tool/menus on their screen and it obstructs your focus and workflow. With MKP you can arrange the tools/menus from your software on the MKP screen as you need them, using the existing layout of the software or by creating your own layout, while adding the option to use them by touch. This frees up space on the main screen as these tools are removed which gives you more free space to work in the same way a second upright screen would. The extra option to use gestures, as the MKP is a touch screen device, to zoom in/out of the tools gives you a more user friendly and productive interface.If you are one of those people who use music, game/graphic/web design, CAD, video editing, animation, software programming, simulators and games software especially have many keyboard shortcuts to memorize and use which burdens your mind as you have many other things to remember when working. With MKP you can create an unlimited number of your own templates with any feature/function for any software you need and design the layout on the screen however you want. Then you can save any keyboard shortcuts (Macros) as you want them set to a single button. This simplifies your workflow and experience so makes it faster and more creative. An unlimited amount of keyboard shortcuts can be set to an unlimited number of single buttons making accessing the tools with a single press very simple. MKP can show any layout of any set of tools from any software on the screen (using templates) at anytime you need them.For music production, game/graphic/web design, software programming, CAD, video editing, animation, gaming and simulators users there are so many dedicated keyboards on the market at the moment which are designed to be used with this software. Using several of them for several different bits of software fills the desk (congested table) and means you have to unplug one to plug in another when you change software. With MKP you get the option to switch templates in a split second which allows you to have instant access to any number of dedicated keyboard layouts by just loading the template needed for the software you are using without any rewiring/extra cost/time. Dedicated keyboards have a set layout and the user has no way to change this.With MKP the user can follow this standard layout or they can create a template which works better for them. The option to use several layouts saved as templates only adds to the flexibility of MKP and the advantages it offers to you as you work. For music users the problem is the same if not worse. The amount of MIDI controllers fills the desk and the cost of dedicated MIDI controllers adds up very quickly. With MKP you get the option to switch templates in a split second which allows instant access to any number of MIDI controllers without any rewiring/patching/spending required. You can also perform all the tasks of the music production process (recording/editing/mixing/mastering) without the cost of separate dedicated MIDI controllers for each process. You can use buttons/faders/twist knobs/basic keyboard shortcuts on the touch screen for any feature/function of the music production software including full control of VSTi/Plug-ins. MKP makes music software very quick/simple to use in a productive/creative way and is cost effective.Music users you get other advantages too besides switching the templates and access to any MIDI device. With MKP you get a powerful live tool which is equally powerful when used in a recording studio with any music production/DJ software, in the same way any other MIDI controller could be used but with the additional advantage of touch screen technology and the templates format. It may also duplicate the layout of your favorite MIDI controllers that exist already or will exist in the future. You can simplify your work by using the templates provided or creating your own. MKP can do the job of any number of MIDI controllers from the single device. The cost of purchasing separate devices to fill these requirements would be far more expensive and the space required in your studio adds up very quickly.MKP helps to reduce the cost of adding, updating and maintaining dedicated keyboards/devices or MIDI controllers as you can create or download new templates for any new requirements at any time you need to for FREE FOREVER. MKP is a touch screen device and as it is a screen/monitor it is backlit as any monitor would be. This brightness can be set to suit any situation you are in especially when you work or play games in a dark room or if you are a DJ playing music in a club. As with any monitor the MKP allows you to set the brightness of the display. This setting can be saved with the templates so each template can include the brightness setting for that individual template if needed. Additionally you can adjust the brightness at any time you need through the menus within our software or even set a keyboard shortcut button function for brightness within your templates.

We will include LEFT AND RIGHT HANDED VERSIONS of these where needed. We will include these templates simply to give you something to use right out of the box so you do not need to start making your own templates in the first minutes. These templates will be editable so allowing the users to customize them to meet any other/additional needs quickly and easily. There will be many more templates available on the website which are created by us and shared by other users and are ALL FOR FREE, FOREVER. Users will have all the tools they need to create their own templates for any software right out of the box. We have designed these tools to be as simple to use as possible to allow the users to take full advantage of the MKP and use it in any way they want. While our software is very simple to use to create anything the users will require it is also designed with developers in mind. The MKP SDK and API will also be included with the units at no extra cost so allowing developers to start working on their projects right out of the box. This means that everything you need for developing your own projects is provided allowing you to use the MKP in any way you require with no additional cost, downloading or installing required. We came up with this idea and did the research and development in 2010 but at that time the cost of touch screens for the mass production would not have offered a cost effective product to you (the users) so we put the project on hold and kept our eye on the prices of touch screens. We spent almost two years designing both the hardware and the software. We have been searching for the most ergonomic design for the hardware and for the best selection of functions for the software. We have partnered with a company in the US due to their reliability and quality. This company was selected as they specialize in and only makes touch screen hardware so they will perfect the product and the internal wiring while keeping the software within our own team of programmers. They have been guiding us and leading the hardware development side.Below are the designs for the units as they will be for the final productionUnit design - FRONTUnit design - SIDEUnit design - TOPBelow is a 3D render of the final unit design3D RENDERBelow are some photographs of the prototype Our prototype does NOT look like the final unit design as it is for screen and software testing ONLY!We have called this prototype the MKP-UD3MKP - Master Keys ProUD - Ugly Duckling (from the children's story about the ugly baby duckling that grew up to be a beautiful Swan)3 - Because this is the third prototype to datePrototype unit - FRONTPrototype unit - SIDEPrototype unit - TOPPLEASE NOTE – THESE PHOTOGRAPHS ARE THE PROTOTYPE ONLY!

To ensure that the quality of the hardware and the software reaches the maximum potential and user satisfaction we have already planned the best workflow from and the next new features and functions that will be added. We will entrust our partner in the US to do the mass production of the MKP as they are a very reliable partner with a rich production experience. The programmers are trusted to design the MKP software base on their variety of experience within music, graphic, gaming and other software. All funds put towards the MKP will be devoted to each workflow to ensure that the MKP project is a success. We now need your help to get MKP out into the market.Every single unit you buy from us helps us to change to a new generation of computing and to be productive in every field including graphic / web design, CAD, music, gaming, any simulators and also home use.Please help us reach our target of 4500 units worldwide and hit our first funding goal. there are 101 lower quality products out there but they ALL come with disadvantages when compared to the MKP. These products are simply inferior to the MKP and won’t offer you the same quality or results in your day to day use. 1)	There are companies out there who have similar ideas to us but they’re still far behind our product and results in every aspect because their research and development is very limited. Our understanding of the products requirement are far deeper due to our diverse team and their experience. Our research and development has included industry professionals in every area we intend the MKP to be used so we know our features, functions and design meet your requirement.2)	There are companies out there who are simply trying to duplicate our ideas but their quality, design, cost and specification aspects simply DO NOT MAKE SENSE AT ALL. Their limited screen size restricts the products ability to offer everything you require and in many cases the units are not ergonomically design. The price they offer is so cheap because they have limited features and functions and use low quality manufacturing. (see points 3&4)3)	Some companies are selling their products for less than 300 pounds which can only mean they are using low quality screens and plastic frames and low quality manufacturing. There is no way to get a high quality custom sized screen if the budget is so low and at such small order numbers. 4)	Most other products offer you far less features and functions so don’t bring you much of an advantage in your creativity and productivity. They have smaller screens so offering you far less space to work with touch and not offering you the full advantages of adding touch to your work. 5)	Many of them are battery powered with limited usage time and no direct USB power so you cannot use them for a full day of work and you cannot expect these products to last several years due to the general wear and tear and average life expectancy of batteries.6)	They have far less key presses per minute which will force you to slow down or not be able to perform some tasks at all and the higher latency will have an effect on your accuracy of work. This applies mainly in the music business but also applies to many other industries. 7)	These companies will expect you to pay extra for additional templates / layouts to use their product with other software which we will NEVER do as our website allows users to share templates freely with no restriction and our software is designed from the beginning to allow simple import / export of templates. 8)	Many of them are manufactured in places where we all know the quality is far lower than US manufacturing and several of them are running funding at amounts we already know will not cover a high quality screen due to our several years of research and development developing this product. We need to get the production volumes up in order to get the price down! It's as simple as that. With your help, we need to: Convert our prototype to the actual device ready for mass production Get all the appropriate regulatory approvals Deliver the fantastic products with even more capability to the backers To spread this smart invention to the whole world so everyone can use it for better productivity Taking functional prototypes all the way to quality retail products is a complex process that requires additional resources, both in capital and manpower. Now that we are at the point where we have proven our various technologies and demonstrated them in public, we have come to Kickstarter to help provide us with the assistance we need to become market-ready. ‘Great music, great graphic, great games and great designs come from great developers!’MKP is about a lot of things but first and foremost it is about the multifunctional touch screen keyboard/multi touch for anyone who does music, DJ, game/graphic/web design, animation, software programming, data entry, CAD,simulators, gaming or home use, Adults to Children, Beginners to Professionals. Many people do many different things at the same time, for example a sound designer also does graphic design work as his interest or a job so MKP helps him to perform his job easier and save device costs without reducing the quality of his chosen tools for working. Our campaign represents the new era in computing for all types of industries. We are giving the advantages to people who need them for any purpose. It is about a smart option to obtain productivity with the advantages given to the working environment such as creating a less cramped workspace on the screen, unlimited keyboard shortcuts to be set as unlimited templates, easy access to any dedicated keyboards & MIDI controllers, all-in-one music production, performing as a live tools or in a recording studio, a backlit monitor and cost saving for any adding, maintaining and upgrading of dedicated keyboards or MIDI controllers. Overall, we’re so far ahead from our competitors.It’s time to experience a far better way of computing. We’ve been working diligently for years. We managed to create our first working prototype and took time to perfect it. We are now fine tuning our design for mass production. We’ve put a great deal of effort into engineering a very simple and efficient design. We exhaustively tested our prototypes, documenting areas for improvement and systematically refining them. We are very confident in having a solid design. We’re a multi-disciplinary group with vast experience in all relevant music, graphic/web design, video editing and gaming fields. As part of our progress we have assessed all the challenges and risks which are part of making such a multi industry device. Some of the biggest risks are already behind us. We had to overcome a lot of challenges in order to get to where we are today. No one wants to see a good idea executed poorly. We’ve worked extremely hard to prepare this product for manufacturing and we’ve worked very hard to de-risk as much as we can before this campaign started. We’ve gone through the highly innovative design for manufacturing. As a result we’re nearly ready to begin manufacturing the first run of MKP.   We’ve learned a lot of lessons over the last 2 years and with your support we’re confident we can build a world class product with the MKP.  The challenges we’re facing now are the ones that are always part of the process of taking a working prototype into mass production. A large capital investment is required in MKP MAINLY for reliable mass production purposes which mean that we’ll deliver a great and high quality product with timely delivery to users. The good news is our USA based manufacturing partner believes strongly that Master Keys Pro is BETTER THAN the other similar devices and in our vision of making a versatile single device / keyboard for everyone. Our manufacturing partner will help us not only to achieve the best pricing and highest quality of production for the MKP but also to ensure stock and lead-times are within our production requirements. Our partner has set aside a large volume buffer of stock and factory time to cope with the initial demand from Kickstarter. All we need is the capital to execute this mass production. Our programmers are very responsible workaholics with deep creative development knowledge who work on this project alongside their daily tasks. We’ll continue to work hard on fine tuning the quality to ensure the best possible user experience. Our programming team also has a wide range of experience in the industries which we intend the MKP to be used in. This means they’re not simply designing the software blindly but that they clearly understand the needs of the users, of you and your work, and the results required by you. They have a lot of experience in delivering complicated projects on time within specifications and our development risk is reduced by having dependable programmers working alongside the first rate manufacturer. We’re prepared for future challenges which are ahead of us and we’re committed to keeping you informed of our progress in the following months. There are many challenges ahead in providing a product that is reliable and easy to use. That's why we've been building a crack team of the best programmers around to work on the MKP. We’ve learned a lot from our initial prototypes and we’re working hard to make MKP a future proof device that you’ll use every day. We pride ourselves on embracing innovative ideas and look forward to seeing MKP become a reality very soon. We’re very confident that we can deliver what we have proposed!

Boating with Clyde: Adventures on the Puget Sound|successful|"By now you have probably watched the introduction video for my dream show, Boating with Clyde. But that's just a small part of the project! Check it out!Combining the rich tradition of Fishing with John, Captain Puget, Pee-Wee's Playhouse and The Muppets, Boating with Clyde brings focus to the waterways of Puget Sound and the artists that dwell nearby. Boating with Clyde, a free internet-based program of video shorts, will feature Northwest and touring musicians and artists, performing and storytelling, while adrift on an 8-foot dinghy in the brackish waters.We'll explore the history and science of each area we float through, while learning from local artists where and how they draw inspiration from the waterways of the region. Boating with Clyde aims to launch its first season of production in the spring of 2011. Your help in funding the program would assist in paying the numerous production costs involved in producing this awesome adventure of a show!Boating with Clyde will strive to both educate and entertain adults and children, while building community through both artistic performances and interviews with local boat-builders, marine scientists, tug boat drivers and sea captains. The programs will vary in length from 10-20 minutes each, and be featured for free on my website.Http://www.boatingwithclyde.comThe show will also feature special puppets and animated segments.A fish puppet named Pinky BottomFeeder will give special underwater reports with his friend from Anacortes, Karl Blau.http://www.kelplunacy.com/To see other examples of my animation work, Look Here:Http://www.doitforthegirls.comYour support would cover the following expenses to make this super awesome: (Most of the expenses have to do with safety or filming underwater!!!)- 2 Hydrophones - underwater housing for a digital camera - a digital camera - additional life jackets - a larger motor - an extra marine battery (to avoid that stranded feeling) - 2 Lavalier mics - video tape and hard drives - rental of an underwater super 8 camera + film - underwater lights - wetsuitIf I reach my funding goal, I will go into production this Spring! If you break it down, it looks like this! If 300 people pledged 25$, this would happen. Holy cow! If 150 people pledged 50$, this would happen. WTF! OMG!I already built the boat with some help from friends over 6 years ago. Now I just need your help to go the extra (nautical) mile.(music for the theme song composed by the band Peace! for their song ""SummerTime"". Remixed with permission by Clyde Petersen)"
Beyond the Victory recording their debut EP|successful|We, at Beyond the Victory, are looking for the funds to give our dedicated fans exactly what we feel they deserve.  We're looking to add more to our family of friends. All donations recieved will help us record our first professional EP with the best quality possible for our fans ears. With this EP we hope to expand our BTV family and fans across the world with our music. Your generosity won't go unrewarded or unappreciated. We are asking for a little bit of help from you guys, so we can take our band to the next level and repay you guys back tenfold. We hope to put out the best music for you guys as possible. Help us reach our goal and you won't be dissapointed, we promise! Our challenge right now is facing the fact that we cannot raise enough money in time to be able to book the recording date.  We are recording all of the pre production tracks by ourselves and we are risking the fact that some tracks may not be good enough for the studio's standard.  After the project is funded we will get all of the backers what they wanted in the fastest time possible.  We are going to log all of the backers to ensure they get their rewards.
DayStay|failed|About UsMy experience as a long time Superhost on the Airbnb platform has provided my family the enjoyment of meeting wonderful people and an opportunity to generate additional income for monthly expenses.  I was inspired by the popular homeshare movement to create a new platform for those that are interested in sharing their homes for short term “day use” versus hosting overnight guests. Whether hosting in your primary residence, a second home or a rental, there is an opportunity to list your place on DayStay for a variety of gatherings AND generate extra income .DayStay users will find the Ideal space on the platform that will not only accommodate their events or meetings in a warm, private environment but they will also save money compared to the exuberant fees found at  most event venues. DayStay is ideally suited for gatherings of 20 people or less.  Some examples would be:Midday Business MeetingsBridal or Baby ShowersIn Home Retail PartieHosting a Children’s PartyDIY craft parties, etc. We are patent pending, Llc, and we are getting ready to submit our completed app to the mobile stores for review. We are planning a soft launch in the Bay Area of California once we are approved by the app stores. We are hoping the Kickstarter community can help us fund this 12 week launch.  Once we launch and have a significant amount of homeowners and guests completing successful stays, we will seek further investors to launch nationally later this year. Our project has come so far this past year.  Our product is fully developed, and the user friendliness is very comparable to the Airbnb site.  After hiring attorneys to get the proper waivers in place, the LLC, the patent, and the development, our marketing budget has been depleted.  We want to make sure our app has the best chance of success, s owe need people to sign up and use it!
THE LEAGUE OF HONOR|failed|THE STORYThe League of Honor is an action adventure based on a selected allegiance of regulators whose primary province is to ensure that justice prevails throughout the dimensions of time. The League of Honor represents integrity, bravery and loyalty. Individuals can only be admitted into The League of Honor when they have demonstrated principals of benevolence during their lifetime. They enter The League of Honor and are inducted only after they have saved, valued or placed another life before theirs and, unknowingly, risked their own life before thinking of the outcome. The League of Honor exists worldwide and throughout time. Members are called upon individually or as a complete unit when needed.WHY KICKSTARTER: The League of Honor is a project I began creating over 25 years ago. When the story was completed, I was well on my way with a graphic novel and a possible film. However, just as I was just about to introduce The League of Honor to the world, my mother, father and sister unexpectedly lost their lives. That unfortunate happening drained me in every way and to properly take care of them took all of my life savings. Climbing back up and just getting to the point where I was able to breathe again took every thing I had. I am finally ready to get this project back on track and I am setting my sights on the goals I had set for myself years before. The story of The League of Honor gave me the hope and strength I needed to survive. I am ready now to take this project where it needs to go and Kickstarter is the best way to help me get there.WHY YOUR HELP IS NEEDED: Your generous contributions would help to hire a team of artists to bring the world of The League of Honor to life and to create a series of graphic novels based on the characters. Your contributions would also help to create a small companion book and to obtain a booth at Comic-Con International to introduce The League of Honor on a larger scale. The funds will also help complete our website to further spread the message of hope that The League of Honor brings.Please visit http://www.theleagueofhonor.com for more information.
making more bringpacks|failed|Please support this project by helping us get enough pledges to meet the goal. We can't make more bringpacks unless the goal is met. Stay connected through Kickstarter and Facebook for developments in the bringpack designs as we get feedback from supporters.You can pre-order your bringpacks by clicking a pledge amount. Kickstarter works as a source of crowd funding by charging supporters their pledge amount only if the goal is met. After the funding deadline, there will be a survey for all the supporters to get information to finalize their orders and get shipping information.What is a bringpack?Bringpacks are pop-up backpack baskets and can carry many bulky items while leaving your hands and arms free. Bringpacks are made of polyester and steel, so they will not mildew or rot.Why are bringpacks special?Many features set bringpacks apart from all other utility carriers. Most notably, bringpacks fold up and tuck into themselves for storage. Plus they offer all the conveniences of a standup basket. And they are very comfortable on the back unless there are poky objects.Additionally, bulky loads can now be carried on the back, which greatly reduces back strain and the likelihood of tripping. Parents, students, and kids of all ages have found so many uses for bringpacks that it may be impossible to make one design that satisfies everyone completely.How is your bringpack going to look when you get it?We are actually happy to say that this product is in the design revision stage with our manufacturer. This means that there are design decisions still left to be made. Color, strength/weight, and overall size will be decided by popular vote of all backers. We need to meet the manufacturer's minimum order for individual styles, but we may be able to do different colors as part of the minimum order.Why are bringpacks on Kickstarter?I got a country music song life right now and I can't make bringpacks inexpensively enough myself. Kickstarter appears to be the best bet for getting the kind of feedback we need to make bringpacks truly awesome and raise the capital for the initial production run.Why a goal of $15,000?$7,000 for minimum order of bringpacks (5,000qty)$2,000 Overseas freight$4,000 Domestic shipping of rewards to backers$200 Quality/Rework/Handling$1,800  fees and taxesStretch Goal: $20,000 Get your photo on a bringpack!

Projecteo: The tiny Instagram projector.|successful|Projecteo press coverageProjecteo is a tiny Instagram projector. It uses wheels of 35mm slide film you make online and each one holds nine photos. Whether they're of your best friends, that holiday last summer or good old pictures of cats, just pop them into Projecteo, focus by twisting the lens barrel and sit back to enjoy your slideshow.We've developed a process to get your Instagrams onto a single frame of 35mm Kodak film stock, which is cut into a circle and fits snugly inside a wheel.  To change wheels, just gently pull it out and place the next one in the slot. You will be able to collect as many wheels as you like.No pixels, no pixelation.Like all projectors, Projecteo works best in the dark. We've had great looking images up to two and a half feet wide in a pitch black room. Unlike screens, slide film doesn't have pixels. This means you get beautiful looking images from a device the size of a matchbox.The functioning prototypeSLS printed prototypeWe started off by 3D printing early prototypes of Projecteo. Sure, it was rough and stuck together with tape but it had enough charm to make us fall in love with the idea. We wanted to see how far we could take it.Through an iterative process, we optimised the focal length of the lenses and added a focusing mechanism. We looked for the most powerful LEDs we could find, made the batteries replaceable and figured out the perfect ratio of images per wheel. We modified the outside edges to give Projecteo a five degree chamfer, to make it a bit nicer to hold. Oh and of course, we gave it cute little feet.Though we had a prototype that did everything we wanted Projecteo to do, we were not ready for manufacturing. To take us through to that next step, we started working with Meso, a product development consultancy in Scotland. With their help and guidance, we made a production prototype.We now had a model with parts designed to be injection moulded and all components custom made to fit right in the case. The surface finishes are high gloss on top with a textured matte grey bottom. We now also had a production prototype circuit board, the miniaturised version of the electronics we would be able to make at scale. As a final touch, we made the button a bright, fire truck red. Buttons you want to press are always red.With a working production prototype, the beginnings of tooling and the first sample ready to be injection moulded, the hardware was coming together nicely. But we also had to figure out how you pick your images online. Luckily, we know a thing or two about that.How do you pick your images?Mint Digital is an agency and product development company. We collaborate with startups to large companies to make digital products. We also invent, build and run our own ventures like Foldable.me and Stickygram, giving us quite a bit of an experience in connecting to Instagram and turning digital pixels into physical stuff. We've also learned a lot about fulfilment and shipping to the world.We've already been hard at work on the web component of Projecteo and will continue to polish the experience. For now, here's a sneak peek.How do your pictures become slide film?Our developers in the US use a similar technique to how Hollywood convert digital movies to 35mm film to project in cinemas. Your Instagrams are 'melted' on to a single frame of Kodak film, which is then processed in a similar way to how analogue films are developed, except in full colour.From the development trays, we cut out individual sets using our custom circle cutter. We then place each unique piece into one of our wheels.Screws, not glueProjecteo has been designed so you can disassemble it.  This will not only make them easier to recycle but it means you can pull it open and see what's going on inside. There, you will find a super bright LED, capacitors and resistors, a switch, a decade counter and three batteries. Feel free to hack away! We can't wait to see your creations.Where will it be made?The components will be sourced and injection moulded in China. The factory we are working with is in Guangdong city and adheres to all labour condition laws. It's run by a nice gentleman called Henry, who looks after his staff well. Assembly of Projecteo and the development of images will happen in upstate New York, at a professional photography lab run by a lovely man called Neil. He will take care of printing your Instagrams and popping them into wheels.When will you have Projecteo?With successful funding, we will be able to make Projecteo between mid-December and mid-January. After manufacturing, units will be drop tested to the American standard and EU/FCC certified, which should take a maximum of two weeks. We'll then need to test our fulfilment process to make sure the Instagrams you choose on the site are matched with the physical wheels.Once we have everything running smoothly, we should be able to roll out units to our first Kickstarter backers around late February. We will ship units in the order we receive the pledges, so back early to get Projecteo early!Something special for Kickstarter…The whole idea behind Projecteo came about when Ben found a Rollei film projector and a bunch of slides on a market stall. He fell in love with the beautiful and refined design of the projector and set about to find a way of getting his Instagrams onto slide film.In homage, we'd like to make 1000 limited edition Projecteos in the Rollei P35 colours. We will only ever make these available on Kickstarter.Special Kickstarter editionIt's been a long and difficult but fascinating journey so far, and we can't wait to get Projecteo into your hands. However, there are still a few bumps along the way and we need your help to get us there.Thanks for taking a peek.Projecteo is a project by Mint Digital. With thanks to Meso Design.There are inherent risks and challenges when developing any sort of product, be it physical or digital. When we mix the two, it gets slightly more complex. We've got a great team working on Projecteo with the right skills and experience to finish the job. Here is what we face in the upcoming months.1. Financial backingWithout your support, we can't cover the cost of tooling and get a handle on the minimum order quantity we should commit to for the first batch. We need your help to get us there.2. Refining the toolWe have made a pretty good start on this and produced some first samples. To get the tooling to the standard we require at volume will take more time, money and effort.3. FulfilmentThough we have our circle cutter, we will need to install it in the photography studio and look to set up an efficient and accurate fulfilment procedure to produce wheels at scale for Projecteo.4. WebThis part of the project is well underway. Making digital products is something we have the expertise in, but there are still tricky problems to solve. We'll keep working at it until we get the experience of creating your wheel just right.5. RolloutOnce we reach our funding goal, we'll need to send Projecteos to all our backers. This will involve shipping from China, assembly in the US, developing each individual film and wheel, boxing them up and sending them across the world. We have experience in this from our previous ventures, but Projecteo is just that much more complex. We are looking to trickle units out in increasing volumes to test all our processes as we go and iron out any kinks as early as we can. With your support, we can tackle anything that comes our way and get Projecteo out in to the world.Thanks for checking out our project and have an awesome day.Ben and the Mint Digital team.
Digital Aristocracy: A Commoner's Guide to Digital Riches|failed| Welcome to the Digital AgeWhere technology is king and those that create it become noble.Digital Aristocracy is the fruition of years of study at various universities and looking at both past and present trends in economic history. This book will profile some of the current members of the Aristocracy and their climb to nobility.  It will include my own personal journey/creation of a digital manor with www.vuzama.com. The book will also highlight the road for others to follow should they dare to acquire digital riches.Why raise money on Kickstarter? Build an audience (I want to know that people are interested)Establish a pre-order market for my bookTo self-publish the book ensuring that my creative influence is unalteredPeople to hold me accountable to finish on timeWhat the funds will provide:The book. Plain and simple, I need money for all the research that will go into the book. So far this endeavor has cost a tidy little sum. More than I originally thought I needed. Additional funds will allow me to complete the project and get it to print. This includes more research, artwork and publishing costs.What I provide in return:The use of goods in appreciation is a time tested model. Furthermore, I feel that there is no better way to say thank you than your name being printed in the book and a keepsake so you can always remember. Digital Aristocracy in the news & internet:http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/02/15/president-obama-courts-silicon-valley-s-new-digital-aristocracy.html http://laurenoutloud.com/main/index.php/tag/mark-zuckerberg/ http://sacrebleuwine.tumblr.com/post/460989245/probably-the-most-insightful-and-profound-comments http://googleexposed.wordpress.com/2012/02/24/google-has-too-much-influence-in-washington-and-abroad/ http://www.joelkotkin.com/content/00556-new-class-warfare Here is a blurb from the book:                Afterreading various news articles and books I began to see a trend occurring. Thistrend could easily be called the rise of the Digital Gentry. Thisclassification was a combination of both the technological age and the social classthat it represented. The first occurrence of this Digital Gentrificationoccurred during the “dot.com” explosion as multi-millionaires were created overnight and a class of individuals rose out of that, the DigitalAristocracy.  Today the Digital Aristocracy lives a privileged life of jetsetting and leisure. For all of those interested in joining the DigitalNobility, they must start on the path as part of the Digital Gentry. They mustbuild their Digital Manors, hire Digital Knights and set forth into the DigitalLandscape for fame & fortune, and let this be your guide to Digital Riches. I hope you enjoyed it so far, and please support the Digital Aristocracy: A Commoner's Guide to Digital Riches. Daniel R.

It's Time to Move On|failed|"In closing, THANK YOU!As we close out our funding, a HUGE thank you to all of our backers!  You are the reason this project is possible, and we appreciate your support.  If you missed your chance to participate in the Kickstarter campaign, you can still get your own pair of Broeks over at www.goforbroek.com.  And you can stay in the loop by Liking our Facebook page (www.facebook.com/goforbroek), or by Following us on Twitter (www.twitter.com/goforbroek).Please continue to spread the word, and we look forward to producing and delivering your first pair(s) of Broeks!Jay and ChrisIt ain't Broek, so we intend to fix it.Why Broek, why now?There are literally hundreds of men's brands to choose from, but how do you know what to buy?  Do you choose based on budget?  By brand?  By cut?  By fit? By look?  Is the quality of the denim relational to the amount of money you're spending?  How much are you really paying just paying for name?  Aren't most of the top manufacturers using similar denim?  Is selvage denim really that much better?  Is heavier denim more durable, but less comfortable than a lighter weight denim?  What makes a pair of jeans comfortable anyway?  How much of it is cut?  How much of it is fabric?At Broek, we think that the last thing the world needs is another straight legged, conformist pair of men's jeans.  The time is right to move on, to try something new and different.Changing the way you view bottomsIt all started with a desire to come up with a better fitting jean, but along the way we noticed something.  What would you wear when jeans weren't really appropriate, or you just wanted something different?  Dress pants?  No, 5 days a week at the office was enough.  Chinos?  No way, most shoelaces have more style then chinos.  Cargo pants?  Really?  So, what was there then?  There really wasn't a viable alternative.Born out of this void between jeans and pants, we found an opportunity, a hole that desperately needed to be filled.  With this new mission we set off to create something new, but yet familiar.  It feels like your old, favorite pair of jeans, but with the look of an awesome pair of pants.We give you the fruit of our labor, we give you our Broek bottoms.Introducing Broek bottomsSome of the available colors to choose from.Broek's proprietary wedge cut bottom let you have the style of a longer cut without all that pesky fraying.Of course your Broeks will have a chain stitched waste band.It's not a coin pocket, it's a phone pocket!

We’ve teamed up with a production house in downtown Los Angeles, who have done sample and development work for Joes Jeans, J Brand, Paper Denim and Cloth, Guess, and Resin, just to name a few. Not only do they have the most talented sewers we’ve ever seen, they are also the most expensive development house in Los Angeles, and have a year long waiting period for new clients. We’re using reinforced overlock stitching throughout the entire pant, we’ve put hidden bar tacks in all of the high stress areas, and seen to all the little things that make a pant durable for the long haul.  This includes  unbroken chain stitched waistbands, and heavy duty reinforced cotton for all the liners. Bentley and pants just had a baby, and it’s our Broek bottoms.SizingYour Broeks will be available in waist sizes 28"" through 38"".  Inseam sizes will be available in the industry standard Short, Regular, and Long (30"", 32"", 34"" for waist sizes 28"" through 34"", and 32"", 34"", 36"" for waist sizes 36"" and 38"").  For all of the specific measurements, check out our sizing / fit chart below.Sizing / Fit Chart (subject to slight variations as we head into production):Tailor TemplateWe love our wedge cut bottoms, and we know you will too, but what happens when you don't fit into the normal available lengths?  Great question!  Every pair of Broeks will ship with a ""Tailor Template"", which will provide your tailor with the leg bottom pattern.  This eliminates any guess work on their part, and should result in a perfect fit.Going for Broek together!At Broek we want to involve you in the process.  We have set a funding goal of $25K, which will allow us to complete a first run of our new Broek bottoms.  We've also set a stretch goal of $40K, which will allow us to expand the run to include additional colors and washes (which you will help us decide).We can't do this alone, we need your support!  We hope that you will find a reward level that suits you.  Your purchase will not only help us execute our project, but you get to be one of the first people on the planet to discover what it is like to strap on a pair of newly minted Broeks.Can't contribute financially?  No problem!  You can give us a big boost by simply giving us a ""Like"" on Facebook (goforbroek), following us on Twitter (@goforbroek), and telling your friends what we are up to.Every little bit helps!Also, at the conclusion of our Kickstarter project you can keep up with where we go from here by checking out www.goforbroek.com.  Can you say Broeks for women?As with any project there are risks, and a fashion project is no different.  We feel confident in our ability to deliver, based on years of experience executing highly complex projects on time and on schedule.  We have established relationships with industry players, who make it their business to keep the major brands happy and coming back for more.  Of course, we are certain to hit a bump or two in the road, and we stand ready to navigate them without negatively impacting you, our backers, from getting your hands on your very own pair of Broeks."

Saber Design Apparel|failed|My name is Jonathan Marrs. I started Saber Design Apparel with one goal in mind, and that was to design shirts that reflected my passion for creativity. To get a sense of the style and design language, you can visit https://saber-design.myshopify.com where you can view the initial product line of 17 original shirts and learn more about the company. Every design is fully completed and ready to be printed using direct-to-garment printing once an order is placed.My workstationTo expand the design library and grow the brand, I am raising funds to create more designs and polish the website. Every Saber Design product is created from the ground up and includes designing, production, and finally an addition to the product line. Through Kickstarter, I plan to create 10+ new designs for the existing product line and also create designs for women's apparel. It took me months to finalize the initial shirts for 2017, but I am ready to work harder than ever before to push out more quality shirts than ever before. In addition to funding, this project will also serve as a motivator to create better designs for the brand.The process of expanding the brand Always looking to the future I am making more designs and working on Saber Design Apparel to make the brand the best it can be. I am not working on any other projects; this is my only project, all of my personality and energy are funneled into my brand.
Capturing the Soul of a Town|failed|I have taken a big dive off the deep end to pursue my passion - to tell the story of Fairfield Iowa, one of the most talked-about small towns in America. And I have to tell you -  it feels fantastic.  I've dropped everything to produce the Fairfield History Series and leave a lasting legacy for our children and everyone who wants to learn about this unique small town. I love Fairfield and I want to help people connect to this special place on our planet in a way that touches their hearts. If you look at our lives today, what we are doing today, working, eating, living... we're all so busy. This project is about gaining a new perspective so we can live a more fulfilled life today by experiencing and learning from the stories of the people who lived before us.With help from over 75 local volunteers, we are producing the Fairfield History Series, a documentary series of eight films which beautifully depict the fascinating history of Fairfield Iowa and Jefferson County. We just completed our first film “Life Before Fairfield” and we are thrilled at the response. It’s about the prehistory of this area - from the Pangea shift and how our lands were formed to getting to know the native tribes that lived here for thousands of years ago on the land we now call home. Landscape artist John Preston with drone camera overheadWe have just begun filming our second chapter in the series called “Heroes of Fairfield” about six ordinary people or groups of people who did extraordinary things for our town and our world. It includes local members of the Underground Railroad and a local Civil War heroine that almost nobody knows about today, yet some believe she saved hundreds of soldiers' lives. In between these stories, we will deliver our history in a way we hope unites and inspires the people who see it.We have filmed over twenty full-length interviews so far as well as over fifty short interviews plus hours of aerial shots of Jefferson County to be used in future films. But we have so much more to do, That includes a tremendous amount of historical research to insure accuracy. We are making sure to interview some of our older citizens right away while their memories are still vivid. Yeah, it's a little crazy as we are filming for all of the films all of the time. Quite an undertaking. But we have some amazing advisors including advisors and students from the David Lynch Masters in Film Program at our local university.Here is where you come in. • Make a Pledge - if you like our project and can help out, thank you.• Tell your friends - if you like this project, just let them know!• Watch our filmTotal budget for each film going forward is $60,000. We have seven films left to produce. So $10,000 gives us a big start for our second film.  It’s important to me to properly pay our artists and musicians as well as our editors who work so hard to help finish our films.  Tentative titles of the seven future films in the series: Heroes of Fairfield Agriculture Heritage and the Future of Local FarmingFairfield Firsts and Economic Development iFairfieldParsons College - a 100 year old educational traditionMaharishi International University (now MUM) - when Maharishi Mahesh Yogi came to town Culture - Artists and Musicians - their Impact on our community The Future of Fairfield - a new generation takes overOne risk for this project is if something happened to me. I am the driving force behind it. I am a very big guy, I'm 61 years old and people might think my health is at risk. But I'm a deeply happy man and I'm not going anywhere. I am here on Earth to do this job and I will complete it. The second risk is lack of funding. That's where you come in. I know there is someone out there who will see the value in this project not only for Fairfield, but as a model for many other small communities around the world. Just so you know, Fair Field Productions is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization. My challenge is to keep this very reasonable budget down while making sure to honor our local artists and musicians who contribute so much to these films. They are so talented and giving. Thank you.

Based on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes, based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal or Stripe. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more promo goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the EU (European backers), UK (UK backers), Asia (Asian backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic pledge, with 1 or 3 games and their related promos. Estimates for 2 games will fall in the price range between the 1-3 estimates. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address and that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose. >>> Note that, in compliance to the EU and UK laws, VAT will also be charged on the pledge manager system for EU and UK backers. At this time we cannot estimate the cost as the charges vary from country to country and it is based on the price of the order plus the actual shipping costs (which can only be properly determined in the system). However, the VAT charges will be fully disclosed on the system to be examined. European countries that are not part of the European Union or UK will not be charged VAT.**Brazil, Africa, and Middle East estimates are based on USPS rates. If USPS is not available, these rates may change.Unfortunately, different import laws, customs, and contractual obligations prevents CMON from shipping to certain specific countries or regions.THIS PROJECT WILL NOT BE SHIPPED TO: Latin American countries (with the exception of Brazil), Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan. Be aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a ""Late Confirm"" and will be shipped from the Asia Hub at a later date, likely incuring increased shipping costs and possible customs fees. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, the content offered on Kickstarter. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.The table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.To learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.This is our 46th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as:Production delaysShipping delaysCustoms delaysThe estimated delivery date for this project is November 2021, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.  We've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. REFUND POLICYWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign’s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that’s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can’t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we’ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.All refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.This project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.TERMS AND CONDITIONSBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.If you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.If you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.All backers that have selected “No Reward” on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All “No Reward” pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.If you do not accept these terms please do not pledge on this project, but instead wait for the retail release.To make sure you have the best gaming experience, all CMON products are warrantied against manufacturing defects for 2 years from the of date purchase from CMON (proof of purchase required).

StoryBox - What will you make today?|failed|StoryBox: A box of monthly inspiration delivered straight to your door.What's your story?  My name is Jen and I want to inspire you. When is the last time you were really challenged? I mean really challenged. For some of us, our day jobs are less than fulfilling creatively. StoryBox is here to help. I want to send you a box in the mail each month containing 5-8 items to inspire you. Look at the items and let your imagination take over.

Along with your piece, you will share how you were inspired by your StoryBox in your project.The uses of your StoryBox are unlimited. You can give a subscription to a friend or order one for yourself. Since the boxes are not age rated, you can order a subscription for your child and do an art project together each and every month.

The items could be small toys, tasty treats, postcards with images, a piece of music or a video, or a quote, story or poem. It's up to you to decide how to use them.For instance, you could get a box that looks something like this promo box we made:The postcard in the box might inspire you to create something like this: ...or like this...What will you do with the money?   All money pledged will be used to create for our first month of boxes to be shipped out in March. You will also help us to fund shipping and to create a large enough website and forum to be able to share photos and videos of your creations.

Cyberines #1|successful|"If we hit $3000 I am giving everyone a free Cyberine trading card. YES! Even you $4 digital guys! Everyone who pledges over $4 will get this awesome reward! Also, Everyone who backs this project will get their name on the backer's page in Cyberines #1. Everyone!Cyberine, the USCC and Shadowflame.Cyberines #1 takes us to the next step of human evolution.  We delve into the past of what turned one of the Cyberines into a deadly enemy. Was he always destined to be? We also introduce a new ""Villain"". The Persian freedom fighter Sirocco. Is he friend, or the worst type of foe?The story, is a simple one. When I was 14 years old I created my Captain America mixed with The Six Million Dollar Man hero, Cyberine. That is 1985 to you young pups. In Bergen Tech Print Shop, Mr. Pavlu tasked us with creating a flyer for something that interested us. Me being a huge comic fan and also had just read Captain America with Deathlok, I created a character to be in that vein. I was also very patriotic as a teen. I still am. Cyberine made his first appearance alongside Agent Napalm in Shadowflame #2(1996/2007) to arrest Billy Barnes, also knows as KillWatt the Electrocutioner. He was hired by Don Tony Baltinetti to kill Shadowflame for disrespecting his nephew Tommy. The Cyberines, or United States Cyberine Corps made their first full appearance in Shadowflame #4(1997/2007) where they helped Shadowflame fight and defeat Maldestrak. Cyberine was in a tragic accident that required the government to make him better, stronger and faster. The cost was a helluva lot more than $6 million dollars.The Cyberines follows a ""family"" of Cybernetic Marines. They are the top tier of elite combat class of soldier: the USCC, the United States Cyberine Corps. Their members are recruited and trained at a young age and then cybernetically or genetically enhanced. This can be due to an accident or injury that has occurred in the line of duty or just to unlock their genetic potential.Cyberines #1 cover by Cory Hamscher and Sean ForneyJoe, Jeff and Sean's cover.The Cyberines first appeared in the Shadowflame mini-series from 1996.I no longer have the first Cyberine drawing that I did. But this is from 1986!Special thanks to the creative team, Cory Hamscher, Pow Rodrix, Sean Forney, Ed Dukeshire DW from Fanboysinc and R.J. Michaels. The book is 99% done. It needs to be lettered and printed. This will mean that the book will be in your hands soon after the Kickstarter is over."
Poems For Apostates & tales of a young Scientologist|failed|"The Church of Scientology is notorious for harassing members who leave and especially to those who publicly speak of their experience.  Good or bad is of no value. Part of the reason for this is simple self preservation.  Its written into the doctrine that all good scientologists must apply the ""fair game"" policies to people who are labeled ""suppressive persons"".  The only thing one has to do to earn this title is leave. They have stood in front of every project I've tried to get off the ground. They still do. Starting over from scratch at 27 years old and losing my career and every person I knew was a process that I experienced alone. It led to an addiction to pain medication which actually was easier to deal with than the loneliness and abandonment I faced.  Eventually I overcame that and much more. I consider myself a surviver and am still meeting those challenges today but finally with the fortitude of knowing who I am and wanting to share that. I know self publishing is the safest route considering the fact that Scientology doesn't want my voice heard.It will happenIt already hasI've gained momentumfrom the bad intentionsof all your bitchingI didn't want this-but its your systemOr rather a religionthat doesn't welcomeindividual thoughtThe artists I knewwho acted like thatgot made examples ofAnd the high pressuresalesman tactics don'tdo you any favorsWhich makes youpander mostly topaper chasersStill trying to figureout what money'sgot to do spiritualityI definitely don't buythat mentalityAnd I won't let gountil you learnsome humilityAnd respect for every humanAllowing everyone thesame rights to existYou don't decidewho is subhumanand who isn'tYou are not divineMy life is mineand you don't define meI am finally still Knowing I was builtfor thisHeart and handsin tandemWords come infor a landingWith reckless abandonI'm stillstanding."

Treasure Trapped|successful|"The Film - What is Treasure TrappedDepending on your exposure to this intriguing pastime, you probably have two questions. What is LARP? And why are you making a documentary about it?For the uninitiated, LARP (live action role play) can be seen as an extension of the fantasy gaming world of Dungeons and Dragons, but this time it’s for real! You may be thinking it’s those beardy guys you’ve seen hitting each other with swords, or maybe the teenagers in the woods playing real-life Lord of the Rings; you would be right, but it’s also much more.  Did you know of those people who recreated a Jane Austen novel and spiced it up with aliens or the folk over in Scandinavia who role-played being stuck in a lift for six hours?These may seem like extreme examples, but that’s just how varied LARP can be. We couldn't believe we'd never heard of LARP before! It probably took us all of one minute to decide to fill a van with cameras, head out into the big scary world and start finding out as much as we could. It’s in the wake of our exploration into this world that we’ve found the real beating heart of LARP. It is the community of people who follow and support their hobby and we want you to meet these people and see why they are so passionate about what they do at the weekend.So what is Treasure Trapped? Treasure Trapped is the documentary film that chronicles our journey into the LARP community. It's our adventure into the adventures of every day people, the history of their hobby and everything in between! How you can helpIf we've been out and about exploring LARP all this time then why are we asking for help? It's a good question!We've already filmed a lot of Treasure Trapped. Like any good documentary though our adventures have lead us to more and more people and the scope of the film we COULD make has grown and grown. So we're looking for that last tiny little bit of support to help us finish the film in a deserving fashion. Your incredibly kind donations can help us round off our journey and present the truest account of LARP we can. Specifically we would like to achieve the following three goals:Visit Østerskov Efterskole in Denmark - This is a school in Denmark that not only teaches through LARP but gets great results through LARP - challenging the common perceptions of the hobby and education itself. We've been invited to film at the school and would love to blow stereotypes of LARP wide open with this fascinating tale...but petrol costs money...and that's a lot of miles to drive!Film at the birthplace of UK LARP - There's many a tale of where and how LARP started but an awful lot of people see Peckforton Castle in Cheshire as the breeding ground for the hobby. Our dream? To take original players back to the castle (now an upmarket wedding venue) to relive their memories. Unfortunately larking around a big castle needs insurance and grounds keeping costs.Show how LARP is...for LARPERS! - What's the most difficult part of LARP to understand? How it must be in the minds and imaginations of the players. It's also the most difficult idea to film...but we're going to have a go! We'd like to open our film with a cinematic opening battle that captures the thrill of the game...but arming 100's of people and capturing a dragon can be pricey! We feel these three things will help us do the hobby justice and round off what has been a life changing journey in a fitting fashion...and we're almost there! We've been given filmmaking gear, clothing, transport, catering, accommodation - so much from so many kind people. We now just need that tiny bit extra to take us to the finish line.If you haven't got the spare pounds to help us on our way you can still help in other ways. We're not all about money but we are all about community. We love to hear from people who can help spread the word about our journey or offer help in some other way. We love it even more though when people have a story they can tell us or a way in which we can help them in return. We've formed so many great relationships over the course of filming so get in touch and lets form another!Who we areCosmic Joke are a filmmaking partnership who've been together since 2010. Director Alex Taylor has been working in films for a number of years whilst Cosmic Joke have been churning out award winning music videos and online treats! Partners Michael Surman and Nick Peel complete the Treasure Trapped trio whilst an army of in house production staff and industry freelancers bulk out the team. We could make up a statistic like us having ""Over 10,000 years of filmmaking experience"" between us...but you get the idea!Cosmic Joke was born out of a commitment to provide students and media hopefuls with invaluable access to work experience. Several such members of Cosmic Joke have been able to get their foot on the filmmaking career ladder from working on Treasure Trapped. Your kind help can make this a bigger film and a far more rewarding experience for our work experience interns.   The extended Treasure Trapped family sees corporate sponsorship from Wicked Camper Vans and Frozen Flag as well as working partnerships with Lindisfarne Mead, Profound Decisions, Wasteland, Labyrinth and many many more! More information about Cosmic Joke and Treasure Trapped can be found at www.cosmicjoke.co.uk or followed on twitter @cosmicjokeuk and @treasuretrapped Whilst the success of Treasure Trapped is by no means guaranteed we've already been accepted for a UK film festival based on our progress so far. We've also had interest in a screening in America as well as a distribution offer from a UK independent cinema chain. With your investment we feel the film has an even greater chance of commercial success. This being a documentary, however, who knows what untold horrors lie in wait for us out on the road? We will be at the mercy of the weather whilst out shooting in the Danish winter...and will probably have a rough time of it in Cheshire too. Similarly, filming a huge, open air battle sequence is no easy feat with the potential for a lot of obstacles. We will need to secure talented actors, the interest of the LARP community as extras and hoards of weapons and armour. Then there's the logistics of the shoot itself, organising (literally!) armies of people out in whatever weather is thrown at us, and there's the safety and working conditions of all our crew and equipment.With all this considered though we are confident we can handle any obstacles we encounter trying to complete our quest, especially with the support of your kind donations! From the months of filming we've already completed we've become dab hands at tackling last minute challenges when they rear their ugly heads.  Similarly all our equipment, crew, transport and permissions are secured pending the money raised from this campaign. There will be problems on the road to completion, there always are, especially with this project being at the mercy of the real and uncontrollable world out there. Frodo didn't have the easiest time getting the one ring to Mordor but he succeeded and we can see ourselves doing the same!"
Suburban Daze|failed|'Suburban Daze' is about three best buds who luckily have the morning off together. After hanging out their day takes a turn for the worse, finding that the suburbs are only bearable with friends... and weed.ABOUT THE PROJECT:This is 'Superbad' meets 'Pineapple Express' and can be done on a 'Clerks' budget, with opportunities for huge return in theatrical and On Demand release. Aesthetically this film will be much like 'Rules of Attraction', with more of a saturated view. With two directing visual styles, this film hopes to elevate the cinematic tropes of the comedy genre.'Suburban Daze' is a personal project, on many levels. Written about the lives of the leading roles with exaggerated scenarios, this screenplay falls very close to home. 'Suburban Daze' was written as a slice-of-life dark comedy with heightened visuals, revealing the beauty within the boring old 'burbs,'Suburban Daze' mainly follows the three leading roles throughout their day, but involves a large cast of unique supporting side characters...PRODUCTION TEAM:HOW YOU WILL HELP:The donations from this campaign will help in almost every aspect in making this film. From comfort on set, to set pieces and equipment, and even post-production, your money will go a very long way. We have created a bare minimum budget for the film, but hope to over shoot it as much as we can. Every penny put into this campaign will be used directly toward the film in some way. With a stripped budget and incredibly loyal friends (mostly working for free), this campaign will increase our chances of creating our true vision.MARKETING:'Suburban Daze' will mainly reach out to 18-40 year old potheads. Based on its aesthetic look and raunchy humor, we are confident it will appeal to a large following from the 18 to late-20's gap. Give us your feedback!We would love to hear from you! Leave us a comment here or on any of our social media pages... or contact us on our website, here.Though we are a new production company, we have done our research and feel incredibly prepared to handle any challenges that may arise. We have been working on this project for over a year now and have had very few problems, but all of which have been easily overcome with the help of our entire production team.One of the few challenges we are strongly overcoming is that of having new talent on set, but with great preparation and rehearsal time we firmly believe this will not be an issue. One of our biggest challenges is getting serious responses from close family and friends due to the content of the film; Most fail to see it as an art form. We aim to disprove our disheartening loved ones by giving the world our raunchy and crude art style for you, our fans, to enjoy! We have also set aside a portion of our budget as a separate 'rainy day fund' for each day of production if any other issues may arise. Some of us also risk being homeless due to quitting our jobs to ensure this film will be made!
Flyover Farm|successful|ABOUT US:  Fresh & Local is a movement tofacilitate urban farming in Mumbai.  We started in the spring of 2010, inreaction to the lack of fresh and organic produce, and the lack of resourcesand support for urban farming in the city.  We research and develop bestpractices, design gardens and garden products, host gardening workshops andwork in partnership with NGOs and individuals to set up kitchen gardens acrossthe city.Fresh and Local’s Flyover Farm project is a naturalprogression and culmination of the work currently being carried out.THE CHALLENGE:  We want to transform 5,000 sqft ofunused rooftop into an exemplar urban farm and community space.  The Farmis located atop a low income, mixed-use building on the busiest street inMumbai.  There is no source for organic produce or any green, open spacein walking distance from the building.  We hope that by showing it ispossible to grow food in a densely urbanized area with limited resources wewill inspire others to start growing (some of) their own food in theunderutilized spaces that surround them.Turning this:(view larger)Into THIS:(view larger)The Flyover Farm will:Grow organic fruits, herbs and vegetablesCompost kitchen wasteSell produce through the rooftop groceryHost workshops to educate and expose city dwellers to the possibilities of urban farming and train urban farmersResearch, design and develop best practices for rooftop farmingServe as an outdoor community and activity space for building residents(view larger)THEHARVEST:  We will grow lots of herbs likebasil (Italian and Indian varieties), lemongrass, fenugreek, coriander, curryleaf, chives, ginger and garlic.  In thesummer we will grow vegetables like okra, eggplant, peppers, cucumber andgourds, and in the winter spinach, beets and lettuces.  Our fruit trees include banana, mango,starfruit, chikoo, lime and lemon. THE QUESTIONS:  How much food can we grow in 5,000sqftof roof space?  How many people will thisfeed?  How many jobs will thiscreate?  How financially feasible is it(in Mumbai) to convert rooftops into community farms?  Fresh & Local plans to develop a modelthat others can replicate and will share all information and findings on our websiteand publications.KICKSTARTER FUNDING:  The Flyover Farm will make use of about 5,000sqft of rooftop.  Phase 1 will focus on half the roof (2,500 sqft) and requires $5,500 (just over $2 per square foot) to be successfully completed.To date the Farm has a 20 sqft vegetable and herb garden, 15 fruit trees, over 50 ornamental plants and weekly yoga classes.In Phase 1 we will add:Approximately 750 sqft of elevated vegetable and herb growing space20 fruit treesShaded plant nursery, grocery and vertical garden structureShaded activity and workshop spaces with tables and seatingStorage shed for tools and garden materialsComposting UnitThe $5,500 budgeted will be used to cover the costs of:Soil and potting mix (about 1000 cubic feet)Seedlings and fruit treesRooftop-friendly growing containers2 shade structures made from natural materials (materials and labor)Vertical garden structure (materials and labor)Tables and seating (refurbished second-hand pieces)Composting UnitTool Shed (made of discarded building materials)Basic gardening tools and drums for storageAny additional funds raised will go towards Phase 2 (on the second half of the roof), to be carried out in October after the monsoon.  In Phase 2 we will add an additional 1500 sqft of vegetable and herb growing space, build an amrut mithi (soil) making station, expand the composting unit, start urban bee keeping and begin our mali (gardener) training program.WHY MUMBAI:  Mumbai is one of the largest and mostdensely populated cities in the world.  As the city grows in size andpopulation, open spaces and farmable land disappear.  Access to quality,nutrient-rich and fresh food is an ever growing problem for all residents,especially the city's poor.  On average food prices have increased by 11%since last year.  Produce travels about 5 days before it reaches marketsand approximately 40% of produce is lost from farm to table.  Because ofthis, produce is often harvested before it is ripe to prevent spoiling, andharmful chemicals such as Ethylene and Ethephon are used to artificially ripenit.  Both these chemicals are known to cause neurological damage.India, along with Nepal, Bangladesh and Ethiopia, has thehighest percentage of undernourished children in the world.  In India,urban children are more likely to be malnourished than children in ruralareas.  This is due to a number of factors, one of which is theunavailability of fresh produce that contains proper nutritional content.Growing food locally, in the vast amounts of useable space(flat, open rooftops and terraces) in urban Mumbai can begin to address theproblem of a lack of access, due to affordability and availability, of qualityproduce.  Additionally, transport time and costs are drastically reduced,and little to no energy resources or packaging is needed to store produce fromthe time it is harvested to sold.  Urban agriculture also holds thepotential to raise awareness about organic food growing practices, healthyeating habits, and provides beautiful, green outdoor spaces for city dwellersto enjoy. THE FRESH & LOCAL TEAM:  Nicola Antaki, NaheedCarimjee, Nanda Kumar, Matthew Nelson, Liam Rees, Adrienne Thadani andcountless volunteers.We thank you for your support and are incredibly gratefulfor your help in making this project possible!To learn more check out our website:http://freshandlocal.org/
FOCUS ON THE FANS: Lions Tour 2017|failed|©Ken Skehan Apr 2017CALLING LIONS RUGBY FANS EVERYWHERE! THIS PROJECTCELEBRATES WHAT YOU BRING TO SPORT! BECOME A FOCUS ON THE FANS SUPPORTERThe Concept: We all know thatbroadcasters and sponsors alike compete to be associated with elite sports forone reason only – to engage with fans who they hope will view their programmesand buy their products. It is the fanswho are the essential reason that elite sport attracts the TV and sponsorshiprevenues it does. They are key to how all major sports secure their primarysources of income. Yet nobody hasever produced a tangible acknowledgement of the huge role fans play in makingsport the biggest attraction for TV rights and corporate sponsorship across theglobe. I'd like tochange that. The plan:  Everyfour years the cream of English, Irish, Scottish and Welsh rugby combine as TheBritish and Irish Lions (the Lions) to take on one of the Southern hemisphereelite teams: New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. So next month I'm going to follow the thousands of fans travelling half way round the worldto New Zealand to cheer on the Lions as they face the mighty All Blacks, inorder to produce a book called FOCUS ON THE FANS: Lions Tour 2017. Lions legend Rory Underwood has said he’d be honoured to write a foreword to the book in which he’ll share his appreciation of what fans mean to the players.I’ve chosen theLions tour as my subject to celebrate fans because I thought it a perfectopportunity to illustrate the lengths fans will go to in orderto follow elite sport. Because Lions tours always take place in thesouthern hemisphere, it requires an enormous amount of time, money andcommitment for fans to follow the Lions. Also, Lions tours are renownedfor high levels of interaction between the world's best rugby players and thehuge number of fans that always make the trip (more than 35000 went toAustralia in 2013). The aim is to produce a high quality largelyphotographic book that illustrates the essence of what participating in a Lionstour means to fans.For me, the tripwill be work. I won't be watching the rugby, I'll be watching the fans. It’sthe only way to make sure I capture candid shots of fans’ instant reactions towhat happens on the field. I want to build a complete study, including:portraying the entire gamut of emotional responsesthat sport inevitably generates: from occasional abject despair to hope,expectation and – literally – jumping for joyCapturing what fans do between matches to enjoy NewZealand’s remarkable geographic and cultural features The variety of ways that fans experience the tour:from budget travel and accommodation, through camper rentals, to those whotravel first class all the wayStadia, facilities and Lions events that bringtogether players, management and fansGathering and sharing tales about fans I meet whohave interesting stories to tellPortraying the sense of camaraderie and fun thatoccurs when fans who would normally be supporting opposing teams leave behindold rivalries and unite in their backing of the higher cause that is LionsRugby With thefantastic advances in mobile phone camera technology, travelling fans can also bemuch more involved in helping create this book about themselves. As well aslooking out for me in New Zealand I’ll be encouraging fans to submit imagesthey take while on tour to the FOCUS ON THE FANS webpage. All images submittedwill be considered for inclusion within the book.The funding: I'm a freelancephotojournalist so publishers, magazines and newspapers don't fund me to doprojects for them. I've committed to publishing FOCUS ON THE FANS independently.Kickstarterseems a great place to start to make this happen.I have alreadyput in place much of the groundwork needed. Publisher and printers are lined upI have a marketing plan I believe is highlyachievable.I have realistic plans for publicityIt’s a massivecommitment though. I will have to travel to New Zealand and be working outthere for 7 weeks. On my return I will select and process book content from allthe images and stories gathered, design the book layout, then pay for the booksto be printed and dispatched. As you might imagine, these are all expensiveexercises.So I would loveto raise Kickstarter backing of £15,000 that will contribute to 50% of myanticipated minimum financial outlay – travel, subsistence and printing costs.I believe in the project sufficiently to invest the rest of those costsmyself. Payment for my time is not included in the £30000 minimumoutlay - I'll only start to be rewarded for that if the target is exceeded.Breakeven aftermeeting all costs of the project will happen at a little under 4000 book sales.I’m confident in achieving this level as it is only around 20% of the estimated number of travellingfans, who I hope will want a personalised memento of their trip of a lifetime,in which they are guaranteed to feature. There is of course also the potentialsales in the wider rugby market illustrated below.The Market: PremiershipRugby attracts over 80,000 paying fans a week on average, (source: AvivaPremiership) and 185,000 participants regularly play amateur rugby (source:Sport England). According to their official data, a further 40,000 fans watcheach round of Super 12 rugby in Ireland, Scotland and Wales, and Southernhemisphere Super Rugby attracts over 50,000 paying customers a week. The British & Irish Lions official website has over 400,000 followersTogether withthe travelling fans, that’s a strong core niche market to engage with on socialmedia and forums before, during and after the tour.Add in the widersports fan book market - where we will ensure through active PR that peoplerecognise the book is dedicated to all fans of all sports - and this couldbecome a go-to present for sports fans in general (published in perfect timefor the 2017 Christmas Market).Marketingactivity plannedincludes:Press and PR coverage before the tour Press and PR coverage when the book is launchedSocial media engagement through rugby fan forumsand communication via rugby clubs to make fans aware of the project and itsrationaleGuaranteeing all Kickstarters who order a copy of the book that they will appearin the book if they submit their photo to the FOCUS ON THE FANS website beforepublication. The first 1500 photos received will be reproduced in a montage on the book's dust jacket.Distribution of the book through direct sales aswell as traditional wholesale/retail book publishing channelsMy credentials: As you mayalready have seen in the video, I've completed a similar venture at the2006 FIFA World Cup Finals. I secured an assignment from Sportingbet PLC tocapture the essence of what it was like for fans attending that tournament, forthe company to use on their website.  When I joinedthe Royal Photographic Society (RPS) I used a selection of those images as mysubmission to the society’s Distinctions Panel and was awarded the highestpossible Distinction on entry to the society - ARPS. I am currently working onthe next – and highest – level of RPS Distinction, Fellowship.Summary: I think thetime is perfect now to bring to fruition the idea of celebrating sportsfans in a book dedicated to them – particularly by involving them in its making.Using socialmedia and traditional media for PR, letting Lions fans know in advance whatI'll be doing will encourage them long before they go to submit images theytake while they're away. I'll use a mix of these and the images I shoot tocreate the bookAlthough I'vechosen this rugby event to create my first tribute to fans, I consider this projecta recognition and celebration of fans of all sports the world over, and inviteKickstarters to help bring to life my first tribute to fans:  ‘FOCUS ON THE FANS: Lions Tour 2017’. A bookmade by a sports fan to honour sports fans everywhere. If you are asports fan I hope I’ve touched your inner feelings about why sport is importantto you. If sport is notyour thing, I’m sure you’ll know plenty of people who are avid sports fans -perhaps you’ll point them in the direction of this project.Thanks eitherway! KenFinancial Risk: The principal financial risk to the project will be if insufficient numbers of people buy the book. I believe this is low risk, because costs of producing the book will well controlled,  and the marketing activity prior to and after the tour should ensure that sufficient numbers of travelling fans will decide to buy the book as a personalised memento of their trip of a lifetime. People risk: Should I become unable to complete the work for as yet unforeseen circumstances it will be necessary to contract an alternative photographer to undertake the assignment on my behalf. After the tour the challenge will be to select from all the imagery the pictures that best illustrate the essence of being a fan following your team abroad, and process the selected images in good time to allow printing in time to meet the anticipated publication date of late October 2017. I have factored in sufficient time for both stages – processing and printing – to be completed within twelve weeks after returning from New Zealand. Both publisher and I consider this to allow at least 2 weeks contingency over and above the estimated man hours needed. I shall arrange for a professional colleague to be on standby to complete the post tour work in the event of me being incapable of doing so for any reason.Technology risk: Professional cameras are highly technical pieces of technology that can go wrong. I use Canon cameras and apart from the fact that I always carry a spare camera, I am a Gold level member of the Canon Professional Network, which entitles me to priority support from Canon worldwide when working on an assignment. The same risk of equipment failure applies to the computers I use to store and process images. I will of course make sure that all my images are properly backed up in a secure environment so that source material can still be used in the event of my computer failing for any reason.

Baby Names NOT to Name Your Newborn|failed|Why do people make such a fuss over naming their babies you may ask? Well let me tell you from personal experience that a name could shape your child’s experiences as they are growing up, their character, or even life. Their name could potentially determine whether or not they are accepted by their junior peers or develop insecurity issues due to name calling and becoming the outcast. A name is a label they will have to live with forever. So why wouldn’t a parent want to give their newborn every advantage they can?Odd and unusual names can become detrimental to a child with a lifetime of teasing and possibly cause lasting psychological effects. As the saying goes, first impressions count! So think twice about Apple and Daffodil. Your child may end up resenting their name and you. You don’t envision your child changing their name by deed poll in the future do you? ABOUT THIS PROJECT:This book is much like the usual baby name book however it contains baby names NOT to name your newborn. The names chosen for inclusion in this book are not as desirable, are old-fashioned, too plain or just plain weird!The book is intended for expecting parents and is the perfect gift idea for mommy's and daddy's to be. It would even make a cute/humorous gift at your friends' baby shower. Or perhaps you and your partner are having difficulties deciding on a name? Well, you could always consult with this book! You could even make a sneaky name entry yourself to prove a point to him or her... (Check out the rewards section!). Those of you who are looking for unusual or different names may even be inspired by this book.I came up with the idea for this book back in 2005 and have been adding to it ever since. What do I know about horrible or unusual names? Let's just say my siblings were blessed with such strange names and I have seen first-hand how painful it can be growing up the odd one out. I have worked as an entertainer at children's birthday parties for over 5 years and recently did a short stint at a call center... Therefore have heard many interesting names! I have also noticed the recent trend in old-fashioned names making a come-back. The names in this book have been work-shopped among friends and colleagues so that the names chosen for inclusion were not  biased.Funding for this project will go mainly towards printing and printing associated costs (e.g. designing front cover, formatting/layout, shipping, etc.) and Kickstarter fee's. I have not decided yet on the printing company but am in the process of shopping around. Content is ready to go! If any of you guys have any questions or requests please feel free shoot me an email and I will reply as soon as possible.HELP SUPPORT THE PRINT/PUBLICATION OF THIS BOOK AND GRAB YOURSELVES OR YOUR FRIEND THIS CHEEKY GIFT!Thank you guys!This book is ready to roll (minus any generous supporter's additional entries). I am currently in the process of deciding on a quality printing company... Even though China has cheaper printing options I have decided I will choose a U.S. based printer to minimize any communication or shipping risks.  I am aiming to post everyone's orders in time for delivery no later than mid-December 2015 (possibly sooner if everything runs smoothly), however I do acknowledge the postal service is sometimes not predictable... if any complications occur I will make sure you are all informed.
Faithful: A Lesbian Mormon Story|successful|Our Film's JourneyFaithful was born out of the need to better understand lesbian Mormons. Over the past several decades, at least 20 movies and documentaries have been made about the gay Mormon experience, but almost no films have been made about Mormon lesbians. This is a story we want to tell.Some of you may be wondering –– do lesbian Mormons even exist? The short answer is YES, although for those who are living on the intersection where faith and orientation are at odds, the world can feel lonely and bleak. Our goal in making this film is to tell an honest story and to foster compassion and conversation around the lived experiences of LGBT+ people. Some live in communities that may have had limited exposure to diversity and as a result, may resist understanding their hearts. It is through spending time with people different from us that we have the chance to cast aside our own misconceptions and learn to love everyone more fully. Now, more than ever, is the time to raise awareness and understanding of those whose orientation may conflict with their faith. What is the Film About?Join us on a journey with Lauralie and her best friend and roommate, Marylu, to experience the joys and pains that any couple in a committed relationship might have –– but with the addition of being fully committed to a religion that is defined largely by heterosexuality.For many people, their religion is the basis for understanding their existence and purpose. However, since much of Mormonism is rooted in a heteronormative paradigm, many LGBT+ Mormons are left despairing as they wholeheartedly seek to practice their religion but also wish to find love and companionship with a person of the same gender. Throughout the decades, they have either stayed in the Church and downplayed their need for companionship or have left the Church and found companionship and existential meaning elsewhere.Meet Marylu and Lauralie Being Mormon is a big part of who they are.  Marylu comes from many generations of Mormons who crossed the plains, and Lauralie was once married in the temple to a man. Together, they live in the plateaus of eastern Utah in Roosevelt, a town of 6700 people. This is a tight-knit community made even tighter by the fact that almost everyone practices the same religion: Mormonism.A large part of being Mormon is believing that marriage transcends mortal life into the eternities and that couples who marry in the Mormon temple can be with each other and their posterity, forever. In order to achieve this highest reward everyone must also follow strict rules in this life. Marylu and Lauralie are following these rules as closely as possible. They are also in love and dream that they too can be together forever. A same-gender couple, however, is not permitted to marry in the temple.What Will My Contribution Do?We have spent the last year making this film and are now in the final stages of editing. A contribution to this project will go directly toward production costs of the film––travel, accommodation, music, equipment, pizza, etc. But more importantly, a contribution to this project means supporting a film that has potential to build understanding and open hearts. We have big plans to screen this film in the festival circuit and in community screenings in California, Utah, and beyond. The more people who see the film the better! We’ve calculated into our production costs what it will take to reach these screening goals and we’re confident we will reach them.We are hopeful that this story will increase understanding in the hearts of those who watch it and offer an important window into the lives of lesbian Mormons. If you've wanted to support a cause that can impact many people for the better, now is the time to contribute!Who are the Filmmakers?Dane Christensen grew up in Utah and is a second-year in the Documentary Film & Video MFA program at Stanford University. His filmmaking is rooted in the belief that the stories we tell can make change happen. His impetus for making this film comes from the urgent need to understand, empathize, and support our LGBT+ Mormon brothers and sisters.Jenn Lee Smith was born into the Mormon faith in Taiwan and was raised partly in rural Utah. She worked in academia for over 10 years and pursued a PhD that focused on telling the stories of women migrants. Jenn Lee is a life-long student of film and writing, and strives to give voice to those who have yet to be heard.What if the project isn't fully funded? Since this is Dane's thesis film, he needs to finish it in order to graduate. And Dane really wants to graduate! If the kickstarter isn't fully funded, the project will continue to be self-funded by Dane.

We are not afraid of this competition as the Intelishake has a better, design, function and look, we realised that there was more that could be done to make drink bottles more useful and provide some useful function to your high energy active sessions whilst remaining in the same price bracket.  Intelishake will provide that missing element, with added compartments which if you decide not to use, can be unscrewed and bottle made shorter into a regular drink bottle. Design was important to us because consumers want more for their money these days and what better than to buy a product that fits in with their style and trend requirements.We estimate that by the time we sell 2000 pcs, we will be able to bring the cost of each unit down to $9.99 each and $14.99 delivered worldwide to your door. That makes our product a serious contender with other drink bottles on the shelf!At this unit price, there are usually no customs or import charges in most countries as it falls within low value goods categorization making it exempt and therefore no unexpected bills on delivery from the tax office in the USA, Europe, Canada or Australia.What We Need, and WhyNewtonstein– that’s the name of our start-up company – has already spent over $10,000 ofour own funds in the development of this project, which has enabled us tocreate a variety of prototypes, apply for our patent, pay for legal fees, setup of logistics and choose a packing operation in Switzerland. Read the inventor's brief diary on processes we went through to set up here.Werequire an additional $20,000 to meet the shortfall for tooling costs andproduction of a starting order of 1000 pieces. This is where you come in and get to grab the opportunity of becoming one of the first backers to put your hands on one! We are not setting any limits, because the more we get funded, the more we can spend on new variations and trade shows to establish this product in global markets whilst putting a team in place to drive its growth through retail distribution!All quotations for tooling and manufacturing ready, we got our final prototypes made by the same factory to ensure they are familiar with the product long term.We have numerous distributors and retailers already showing interest in stocking this product but they require finished product samples, we strongly believe that through this process of crowd funding, we will be able to successfully secure large orders long term once our product comes to life.The challenge is simply to be able to produce our Intelishake in bulk quantities, which will enable us to charge a competitive price. For that reason, funding from our friends at Kickstarter is essential to launch the Intelishake properly.The entire process of crowd funding will inevitably help us learn a great deal more about our market, our product and our direction for the future because your critical appraisal and feedback will help us perfect our invention, after all, it is you that will make use of it the most!The JourneyWe came up with sketches Prototype 1 of Intelishake as shown below, and started looking at perfecting design 3 months ago, reducing costs as the initial design with aluminium casing would cost $75 each. Our aim was to enter the market long term in the $10 - $20 price range .Our revisions produced Prototype 2 which was cool, sleek and trendy. Once we got this in our hands we collectively agreed that it was slightly large with 8.5 cm diameter.Finally we settled on Prototype 3 as shown on all our images which was slimmer at 7.7cm diameter and shorter at around 30cm.   We modified the middle compartment to make it the same size as the top liquid compartment, this would remove the need for a separate moulding tool saving $5000 on cost of manufacturing whilst allowing middle compartment logos to be etched or printed on. From our campaign and product feedback, we decided to include the carbon water filter which is an easy snap on snap off option.The final version is made primarily from Blow Moulding significantly reducing the unit cost of this product and making it possible to put it on the shelf of retailers quicker and cost effectively.Rewards & GoalsMost of our rewards start off with the Green Grasshopper colour as the shipped bottle, but if you want a different colour, please place and order and then once its funded, email us to swap the colour! Our very special beach towel merchandise shipped with eligible orders!The Newtonstein TeamPriyesh is the founder of Newtonstein, and is one of the twoinventors for this small business.  Hehas run commerce operations and designed bespoke ecommerce systems formarketplace selling.

Bailey the Golden Retriever Calendar|failed|"Bailey first became famous due to the internet meme where she is at the computer with the caption ""I have no idea what I'm doing"".  She is a very calm and well behaved dog and I soon realized that she seemed to grasp the concept of getting her picture taken and she would pose.  I decided to take more fun pictures of her and started her an Instagram account in order to showcase these photos.  It has been a hobby of mine to take these pictures of her for several years now.To clarify, if you back this project for at least $15 you will receive a calendar, consider it a pre-order!Her Instagram is: @goldenretrieverbaileyHer Facebook is: Golden Retriever BaileyHer website is: www.goldenbailey.comThis calendar is the first piece of merchandise that we have decided to make and we are making them just in time for the holidays.  It features all of Bailey's best photos and it is sure to bring a smile to people's faces all year round!We really appreciate the love and support from all of Bailey's fans, and we are planning on producing much more merchandise in the future if this initial project goes well!There aren't a lot of risks involved with producing and distributing calendars.  This is more of a gauge of interest to make sure there are enough people interested in getting a calender to make producing them a viable option."

The Spun Monkey Dyeworks and Lounge|successful|After years of doing my work quietly and carefully out of the kitchen or living room, The Spun Monkey has moved (again) and now has a REAL, dedicated studio space! It lives above the garage, is finished and heated, and spacious enough to create the dyelab of my dreams and to host sizable workshops in dyeing and many other skills in fiber arts: felting, spinning, knitting, and fiber preparation.The space needs tools and comfort in order to get started as a real Lab and Lounge. It wants to be a place not only for formal workshops, but for informal gatherings and for drop-in help and tool exploration. Whether it be a workshop with myself or another knowledgeable instructor, a quick lesson, or a weekly knitting/fiber craft night, The Spun Monkey Dyeworks and Lounge wants to be a local destination for fiber enthusiasts in southern Vermont as well as a beautiful space worthy of traveling to for a weekend workshop.Help us turn this empty space into a real Dyeworks Lab and Lounge! Some new equipment, work tables and storage solutions will allow The Spun Monkey to be more productive with our own output, but also to have the space and materials required to share skills with others in an environment conducive to instruction, with elbow room and shared tools in a warm and friendly space.Carders, dyepots, dye materials, spindles, a teaching wheel, furniture (including worktables for felting)...are things the Lab and Lounge needs to fill the space with in order to offer the services we would like to provide. The more money raised, the better and more useful and exciting the space will be for our fiber arts community.
Lux3 – Wellness Lamp|failed|"LUX3 is a wooden designer lamp, in the form of a light emitting cube, that transmits well-being via colored light or through the use of water enriched by color energy. An easily understood app allows you to interact with LUX3 and gives you all the information you need to use it. LUX3 was born from an insight of my life partner, Nadia. Thanks to our joint knowledge (she is a writer and naturopath and I am a designer) I came up with and made LUX3, transforming a dream, that of creating a design object that improves the well-being of the owner, into reality. Uniting craftsmanship with the latest technical innovations, each LUX3 is completely handmade in Italy. The regular layers of the Okumè wood panels are highlighted in a perfect 8"" cube with 45° bevelled corners. A channel constructed on the inside rim of the cube houses  a high quality, waterproof RGB led that changes color through the use of a hidden circuit operated by the LUX3 App. We have known of the beneficial properties of color, and of water exposed to sunlight in colored bottles, for sometime. With a LUX3 lamp you can choose all the colors you want.I wanted to up date this method giving everyone the possibility of improving their well-being by drinking water exposed to color vibration. If you want to relax or prepare to go to bed, choose the blue light. If you want creativity with which to better start a new day, orange light is perfect. For general well-being choose to use all the colors and drink the energy of an entire rainbow.An easily understood app, suitable for both IOS and Android, allows you to light up LUX3. It seemed to me that this would be the easiest way for you to get to know all the possibilities and benefits that  LUX3 and its colors can bring you. These are the options you’ll find: Which color? Can find out the meaning and properties of each colour.Color Emotions: By selecting a single color you can absorb the energy that corresponds to a particular state of mind.Play with color: You can turn LUX3 on and off, choose a single hue or all of the colors in rotation or change at random, for a feeling of general well-being. Colored words:  you can listen to the assertions/meditations created for each color. You can use LUX3 at any time of the day or night.LUX3 can be positioned anywhere, in the bedroom or living room at home, in the workplace or in a wellness centre. You choose.  As LUX3 can travel with you wherever you go, I have designed and produced a practical made-to-measure carrying bag in natural leather. The LUXBag. As you will have realized from my website, I love upcycling, transforming something useless into something beautiful and useful. In this case I have used the only wood left over from the making of Lux3 into a cointray by adding a little leather from the bag production.  The glass shown in the video is for sale. It is made by craftsmen in Venice and certified: Vetro Artistico Murano (Artistic Murano Glass). Since it’s conception LUX3 has changed and evolved through many different aspects. My original objective was to create an design object that could capture the emotional well-being created by color. My first idea was to create an open sided rectangular box containing a hexagonal glass bottle cut in half. The top half of the bottle emitted colored light and the bottom became a glass containing water. Looking at this first incarnation I realized that it wasn’t the recycled bottle that was impotant but the light that colored the water and that that light could surround the glass instead of originating from just one fixed point above. My second prototype therefore became a cube of recycled wood with a strip of LED lights in a hidden channel on its inside. This was fine as a one-off piece, but I wanted to create something that I could reproduce in larger numbers and with a more linear and geometric design. So I replaced the recycled planks with precious Okume wood with bevelled corners, substituted the upcycled bottle with a murano glass from Venice, and added an bluetooth circuit capable of receiving instructions from a mobile phone App. What started as a recycled bottle and painters’ scaffolding boards has become a sleek, cutting edge piece of design which uses the latest electronic technology: LUX3.                     Launching a project on Kickstarter, I can assure you, is a unique experience and seems unending. Nevertheless I would recommend it to any creator who wants to put himself to the test.I had no idea what would happen and how many people would want to share in this project.As you might imagine, I am not alone.These are the partners and collaborators, but most of all friends, that have believed in me and LUX3, giving me their experience, professionality, patience and love in the realization of this project.- Andrea Carloni, from LS Group Italia and Usa, (manufacturer e distributor of LUX3).- Orlando e Loris, with whom I created the prototypes of LUX3.- Marcello Alongi, Video/Editing/Titles - Graphics - 3D Animations - Photography.- Enrico Nanni, young and talented designer of the App. icons and the animation.- Paul Mochrie, voice over, project consultant and English translator.- Alessandro Bellotto, LUX3 logo.- David Selovin, Still life.- Matteo Enea, USA Sales,  LS Group.- Nadia Magnani, naturopath, my muse for LUX3, writer and  voice of the - - assertions/meditations section in the App.- Rossella Nadia Santoro, model for LUX3Letizia Perazzini, Cristina Ballarini, Milva Trani & Ivan Pancotti, Adriano Stramigioli, Pietro Cerri, Alessandro Candiotti, Atlantic Hotel SPA Riccione, San Giovanni Relais, B&B Casa del Tesoro, Guidetti Arredamenti, TRE-V Arredamenti, CT Arredamenti, Comune di San Giovanni in Marignano ITALY.And finally me, Gerardo Abriola, dreamer and creator of my own ideas.Without them and without you none of this could ever of happened.Thank-you, thank-you, thank-you all.  We have chosen the suppliers of LUX3 with great care.

The Living Puppets: Novel|failed|About The Living PuppetsWhat happens when we die? Is it all peaches and cream if you lived a noble life and fire and brimstone otherwise? Nobody alive can be certain, but what is our final destination is nothing like anyone expected? What if what happens next is less like a pleasant dream and more like a nightmare? The Living Puppets is a suspenseful adventure into an afterlife that is amidst a war.The Living Puppets is about a small group of newly deceased find themselves in a mysterious afterlife with nothing but confusion and questions. Soon after, they are greeted by a more experienced spirit who informs them that there is a power struggle against a corrupt and power hungry soul. The group is taken in by the resistance forces who promised to end the evil reign of the man manipulating the living for his own personal gain and they discover that their own deaths may have been a little more than fate.My GoalsI am intending to raise some money to get my book out there. As an independent author gaining exposure can be more challenging that coming up with the ideas and writing the books. I plan on using what I raise to expand my distribution channels, hopefully get my book onto some shelves at independent bookstores, and lauch a more elaborate online campaign than I have done with my previous books.What is in it for you?Besides the satisfaction of aiding an aspiring writer? You mean there's more?  Of course, every level of donation comes with a copy of The Living Puppets either in digital eBook format or a printed copy, plus there are some much cooler prizes offered.About MeI am dedicated to my writing and I hope you are dedicated to supporting the independent writing scene.  To see what else I have been up to and what else I have offered to the literary world visit my website at www.banocanut.com Thanks for your interest!

Projects of Earth: And They Call Us MONSTERS A Story of Bias|successful|"The Inspiration Rob Andersin loved Scooby Doo Growing up.  He Loved the fact that the real Monsters aren't always who you expect them to be and more often they are the people who are looking to make money off tragedies. Rob was saddened to learn that modern-day  Scooby Doo now fights actual monsters and has lost that magic of teaching kids to watch for those with power and means to do harm. Rob being Inspired by this loss of integrity in something he was a fan of and the FANTASTIC Art of CGhirardo's , Rob turned  Classic MONSTERS into REAL PEOPLE with believable back stories and used them to Expose the real Monsters of Life,  those who constantly affect everyday people without care, The Greedy and Corprotasied Americans who seek to rule the world at any cost or loss of life, so long as it does not negatively affect profits THE STORY  In Naples  Florida, our ""Monsters"" have made a quiet life and faded into obscurity.  The ""Monsters"" consist of the  Invisible Man, The Mummy, Frankenstein, and Dracula who are real people, not Monsters,  with unfortunate misconceptions about who they are thanks to the silver screen.  The local police think they know who they are, based on the silver screen, despite not being anything like their Hollywood myths. When dead bodies beginning showing up around them it doesn't take long for the police to try to pin the deaths on the ""Monsters"".  These so-called"" MONSTERS""  must act fast to clear their names and in the process will expose the REAL LIFE MONSTERS living freely under all of our noses. How it all Came togetherRob Andersin and CGhirardo wanted to work together and were trying to make a completely different comic at first. The Orginal Comic book Rob felt was not a good fit for CGhirardo's Art, but Rob was both inspired and inspired by CGhirardo's Artistic talent and wrote a 5 page story about Monsters to match his style and embrace it. The Preliminary art was drawn by CGhirardo and it quickly filled 5 pages with the beginning of an amazing story and suddenly a longer story was born out of enjoyment of creating by both writer and artist. By the time all was said and done a 32-page Comic had been created in a couple of months.你需要支援 HTML5 的瀏覽器才能查看此內容。播放打開聲音重新播放帶聲音播放00:0000:00  Who is CGhirardoA graduate of the Joe Kubert School of Cartoon and Graphic Art, Inc., artist CGhirardo sees comics as art and looks to experiment and push the boundaries and limits of the medium to its full potential.

YEMANJA is located on the edge of one serene island called Careneros, and just minutes away, by boat, from the main drag of bustling Bocas Town.what makes YEMANJA unique?YEMANJA's founders were born and raised in very different parts of the Caribbean - one in Jamaica and the other in Panama. After meeting in Brooklyn in 2008 they decided to bring their respective Caribbeans together, and to design a space that truly reflects the rich and enormous culture of the region. YEMANJA's mission is to change conventional ideas of Caribbean travel, and to create a space where guests and visitors, as well as locals, celebrate this diverse culture, with delicious food, music, and engagement with the local community. about the HOSTELYEMANJA's hostel is run out of a rustic and traditional Caribbean home, along a quiet waterfront, but just across from the busy, main island of Isla Colon. YEMANJA accommodates eighteen guests - twelve inside the house and six more in bungalows. Guests have access to a kitchen, a garden, an outdoor lounge with hammocks and spectacular views, as well as a breathtaking swimming beach that is just a ten-minute walk from the hostel. The rooms will be designed and decorated in a traditional Caribbean style with folk art from around the region. Guests may want to cook and eat together at the hostel, or stroll down the sandy pathway to the watertop restaurant and bar.what about the RESTAURANT?Yemanja's restaurant is a 750 square foot structure set atop crystal blue water, overlooking the surrounding mountainous islands. As soon as you walk in from the dock you will be greeted by our friendly, open kitchen. The dining room, which seats forty people at large, communal tables, will also serve delicious tropical drinks from the long cocktail bar.Right now we have a lease signed on both these spaces and are almost ready to open the hostel! But we need to raise the final $15,000 in order to finish the kitchen, dining room, and bathroom inside the restaurant. what can you tell me about the food?At YEMANJA you'll eat fresh, locally caught seafood. You'll also eat produce grown on neighboring islands, or in our very own backyard! You'll get to taste our ""comida remezclada,"" traditional Caribbean dishes remixed in our kitchen.

Our cocktails will be strong and delicious, and made with fresh fruits and rums from all over the Caribbean.what do i get by donating?Our dream is that all of our supporters will come visit us down in Panama! The larger your donation, the longer and fuller your reservation will be! For example, a $50 donation earns you dinner and drinks for two in our brand new restaurant. A $500 donation earns you a weeks full stay in our hostel plus dinner and drinks each night of your stay!

Jazz Funeral For Coney Island|successful|"James Demaria Productions is planning a traditional New Orleans ""Jazz Funeral for Coney Island"" on Sunday April 3rd.With Darryl ""DancingMan504"" and Jambalaya Brass Band leading the way we will stroll down Coney Island's main thoroughfare in a somber march but when the procession nears the boardwalk it's time for the dead to be reborn. From that point we will second line and dance until we can't dance no more.All symbolizing Coney Island's ""death"" and our hopes for it's rebirth.The money raised will be used to finance the event. It will also be used to make a video to sponsor DancingMan504's ""Heal to Toe"" program. This program teaches New Orleans inner city children to live a healthy lifestyle and to have pride in themselves.About Darryl ""DancingMan504"" Young:Darryl was born and raised in the 9th Ward of New Orleans. He started working with kids after Hurricane Katrina with his ""Heal To Toe"" program. He goes to schools and teaches dance and fitness. The dancing is based on local customs and traditions such as second line dancing. With fitness, he stresses the importance of breathing while exercising and doing your best. The kids learn to have pride in themselves and where they're from.Darryl tries to bring arts and crafts instructors with him when he can afford the expense. The kids make t-shirts and props that they wear to festivals when performing with DancingMan504. Sadly, the schools don't have much money for extra curricular programs such as this, and the local government offers no support. Almost all of the expenses come out of Darryl's pocket, and in his own words, ""The kids need me and I don't mind.""Darryl also has a program called ""Brassercise"" that he teaches at various spots in New Orleans like Audubon Park. This program is for adults and helps him keep his head above water.The average price is $10-$15 per adult for a one hour class. Kids are free. His classes are almost always full--mostly with the ladies who love his energy and boyish smile. Darryl always tells his kids... ""Come to Brassercise. And you're allowed to bring your parents.""James Demaria met Darryl Young two years ago while working on location in New Orleans. They share the same passion for preserving New Orleans' culture and heritage without exploiting it and have become fast friends. Darryl regularly comes to New York to share the New Orleans culture with James Demaria Productions. Whether throwing a Second Line on the Brooklyn Bridge or the upcoming Jazz Funeral For Coney Island, they never tire in their endeavors to teach outsiders ""the New Orleans way"" in hopes of keeping it alive and respected for future generations.About James Demaria:James is from New York and has lived in New Orleans twice in his life. The last time was in 2005 during Hurricane Katrina. Since that time, his work has turned from fashion and advertising to the musicians and performers of New Orleans. His film, Tremé Life, features many artists from the local music scene, including his executive producer Kermit Ruffins.James is passionate about his spiritual home and fights on a daily basis to make sure her culture is not exploited .Please see the link below for our Second Line Across The Brooklyn Bridge which happened on the same date last year.http://www.youtube.com/watch..."

Music is our life and our passion. Our fans have made it possible for us to stick in the game for 2 1/2 years and we love every one of them for their continued support. The last CD was a big success for us to get our name out to the public. Recently the band has taken some down time to start the recording process as we have been writing new music along the way. We want this EP to take us even farther and get our music out to the world. This project is such a big step in our hopeful future careers as full time musicians. We only want to give the best in return to the best fans in the world. Brand New Beginning     On the horizon is brand new merchandise, a professional music video, and a southern tour. This EP is the next level for us and we want it to be heard around the world. It is our dream to do this for a living, and with your help on ""Best Friend Worst Enemy"", we may get one step closer to reaching it.

Blak.Woman.Dynamik-ReBoRn|failed|Blak.Woman.Dynamik ReBoRn is a monologue based production that addresses hot button topics such as domestic abuse, HIV, molestation and much more; all presented from the perspective of a Black woman. The play was first done in 2009 to sold out audiences in Jacksonville, Florida and this time around we are adding content from a male point of view as well. The play has such universal appeal that anyone can relate to the stories of these amazing women and men have to tell. However, in order to make any of that happen...we NEED YOU! We need to raise $6,500.00 and with those funds we will secure the venue, pay for insurance, hair/makeup, funds to pay our amazing videographer and film editor, Paul Steward of 316 Productions LLC, food for the cast and crew, entry fees for Fringe Festivals throughout the country, compensation for the cast....just a TON of things. We also wish to share the this play to schools, homeless shelters and abuse centers in the city and bring theater to those individuals who are not financially in a position to attend a show on their own. Our main objective is to give back to those less fortunate, provide a voice for those who are afraid of the repercussions of using their own and just entertain and educate. We were thrilled by the response the first edition of Blak.Woman.Dynamik, but this time around we are going to step it up a notch; new content, a new cast and a new vision for this production will guarantee that. We have all of the aforementioned...but again, WE NEED YOU! We have some AWESOME prizes for those that pledge; from signed posters to romantic dinner dates with key cast members! Any and all pledges are appreciated and remember the pledge is tax deductible...so cool! So pledge...tell a friend or family member to pledge also! 
Cause Art Gallery|failed|"   Cause gallery is a unique gallery dedicated to exhibiting artwork that has a ""Cause/Issue"" message or the artist is active in similar activities.    For example, one artist is starting her own art program in a very remote part of Africa and I hope to be able to help fund her project by selling her artwork and future art from her students.     Another artist reflects through her artwork her experiences coping with mental illness.   Also I show short films made by individuals with similar themes.  One film maker created a very artistic animation, for cultural awareness of Pakistan and surrounding peoples.     My personal cause is the gallery mission itself.  I enjoy bringing back the type of art that I grew up with.  Times have changed and I believe the majority art has become very success focused and neutral.  Successfully, half of the artist I have contacted are being influenced and changing their genre.  An activist who normally does abstract paintings, is working with me to produce a photo collage of the Seattle World Bank protest that he actively protested in.  A film maker is changing her topics to the problems of homelessness.  A young playwright, seems to have found his new inspiration of meaningful dialog, a great focus.    What I am asking for is help with 2 months of monthly expenses, rent etc, giving me time to find full time employment.  I spent my savings repairing and furnishing the gallery, including a state of the art LED track lighting system I designed myself.  I have been open for 2 months and no sales and not expecting any for the first year maybe longer judging from the history of the neighboring galleries.    Please stop by and visit, the galleries in my area have Saturday openings the 2nd and last Saturday of the month.  Feel free to call me anytime for a personal tour of my gallery.The only risk is if I can't find full time employment, that will pay me enough to cover my monthly expenses.  I also live above the gallery and if I lose the gallery, I lose a residence - Homeless."
ThailandMike No.1, Portfolio, hiccup tour guide & Sketchbook|successful|"  For the past 3 years, I've been circling the globe.  Using my tattooing skills as a passport.   Seeing and living thru the different cultures, foods and different attitudes in this new era of tattooing.  With all sorts of hiccups along my journey, to live, to see, to tattoo, to art.  I feel, it is my responsibility to share.I've put together a portfolio magazine, of my tattoos, of my journey. A compilation of my tattoos and tattoo conventions attended. Along with interactions with clients and contacts abroad i share with you ""Tips and tricks"".  How i manage to survive, to live, on the fly.To assure its weight in gold, I've included a sketchbook of line drawings in this issue.  Original artwork to dissected, to learn from,  to get tattooed.  References, for tattooers to build from.  For students of the arts, to dissect, to rebuild. Designed to be tattooed.Here's a scary thought..... This thing makes it.  This new entity.  It'll revitalize paper publication!  It would mutate into a quarterly magazine!  I would be committed into showing you more of the world, introducing you to more artists abroad and near!  A team would have to be developed...this is crazy!!!Some of the possible hiccup i can foresee along the way..... the tattoos,  its so organic.  it has to be a two way street.   They'll be some compromising, the back and worth discussion on design.  Rest assured, i have only the best interest to my clients and tattoos.  They'll be some prepping on both sides here.  The canvas in this case, will be sensitive and with feeling.I'll practice being a blade of grass, flexible."
Midwest Side Stories|successful|"""You can smell the dirt in the fields, hear the wind as it blows across the plains, and see the people that Chicago Farmer sings about. Each track captures a moment in time, whether for a person or a particular place. Imagine if a John Steinbeck short story had been written as a song, and this will give you a fairly good idea as to what Chicago Farmer accomplishes on his albums"" - Honest TuneFriends,In 2013, Chicago Farmer released an album titled Backenforth, IL. With your overwhelming support, that album opened a lot of doors and I am truly grateful. I was able to tour the country performing at festivals, at venues supporting some of my all time heroes, and even headlining some of the same venues where those heroes regularly perform. Backenforth, IL rose to #33 on the Americana Charts, top #10 on several folk charts, and as I'm told from many of you spent a long time in a lot of car stereos. I'm happy to announce that I'm ready to kick down some more doors and put something new into your ears and car stereos. Midwest Side Stories will be available this Fall (Late September) but for those who Pre-Order it here, you will receive it at your door step several weeks before the official release. “I arrived here, kicking and screaming the day that I took the stage, I went searching for some kind of meaning, like words looking for a page. Came up empty and full of worry that nothing could cover the pain, then these songs and stories began unfolding like an umbrella in the rain.”-Chicago Farmer (Umbrella, Midwest Side Stories) With your support of the last album, and your continued support at Chicago Farmer shows, I'm proud to say that I was able to pay for the studio time, engineering, mixing, mastering, and even the great musicians who laid down their talents on Midwest Side Stories. (Some of them worked for party favors and PBR, but most for cash). I'm grateful to be an Independent Artist able to do such things and couldn't do it with out your support. THANK YOU! We put a lot of heart, soul, sweat, tears, and even some blood into making this album. While the basics are covered, we still have a large hill to climb with ordering a few thousand copies of the album, publicity, videos, radio promotion, and eventually Vinyl etc...The goal is to put Midwest Side Stories in as many ears, hands, living rooms, and car stereos as possible. We've set our goal at $20....because we love you!  Think of this as a Pre-order and special incentive for your continued support. Get to know the new songs before the release shows. Absolutely Can't wait for you to hear it! Thanks!Cody (Chicago Farmer)Track Listing:1. Umbrella2. Revolving Door3. Rocco N' Susie4. Skateboard Song5. Two Sides of the Story6.

Pentimento a documentary about Rene Gimpel |failed|The documentary tells the story of one of the best known art dealers in the period between the two world wars. Rene Gimpel had galleries in Paris and New York, sold to the rich and famous, and knew everyone. Though he mainly sold Old Masters and French paintings, he had a keen eye for the new and collected Picasso, Manet, and Renoir.In the late nineteen thities, Gimpel knew that Hitler was coming and sent as much of his inventory and collection out of Paris. Hitler had planned to loot Paris of all her great art in order to fill his own Museum and as a French man who was also Jewish, Gimpel was doubly targeted. Still, he and his three sons joined the French Resistance. Miraculously, all three sons survived in spite of the hardships and torture they endured. But Rene Gimpel did not survive. He died a hero's death in Neuengamme Camp on Jan. 1, 1945.After the war, his sons found one hiding place outside London and that formed the capital for the new gallery named Gimpel Fils, still operating in London and run by his name sake and grandson Rene Gimpel. The rest of his collection has not been recovered -yet!
Mike Moreno Group - Fall 2011 Release|successful|"Hello everyone, thanks so much for coming to this page. I can't tell you how much I appreciate your consideration on this project.  Some of you have been asking about the new self produced record that has been on hold for way too long at this point.  Well, after tracking the CD back in August of 09 things were put on hold due to funding. Yes, it has been that long!! And things are still not moving along any quicker at this point. So, since this is an independent project, and many people have been asking about pre-orders ect, Kickstarter seems to be a great option. So here fans and friends can pre-order and pledge what they can with rewards involved. After doing my first record (""Between the Lines"") on my own, and then another for a record company, I realized that there is nothing better than owning your own CD and having total control over every aspect of the project that will ultimately be released under your name.  So I wanted to try and do the same for this record and keep it in my hands since it is all my own music, and I have already done half the work and funding. This is a project that I have been really excited about.  A band that includes some of my favorite musicians, all of whom are leading voices in jazz today.  Aaron Parks on piano. Warren Wolf on vibraphone. Matt Brewer on Bass, Ted Poor on Drums and we also tracked some with Jochen Rueckert as well.  I'm sure you guys know these names, and if you don't, check em out!  We recorded 9 of my original compositions.  There are two Quartet formats, one with piano and one with vibraphone.  And we also tracked some of the pieces in Quintet format with both chordal instruments, and there are two duo pieces with me and Aaron as well.  We recorded this at Avatar Studios here in New York.  Which is my absolute favorite place to record, and such a historic space with an amazing sound that is just unmatched.  But also not cheap!!  Same engineer as Between the Lines, Anthony Ruotolo.  So far the rough mixes already sound great, so I cant wait to mix and add more things to this recording.  I plan to mix at Avatar and Master there as well.  If I go over the amount I'm aiming for, we will hopefully be able to update a couple of the songs and do another tracking session.  Then get the design done and go straight to printing.  Since I have already done half of the spending for this record, the amount I need to finish this project is $8,000.  Of course if I do better than this on here, it would help out immensely with publicity and the always inevitable and sure to come but still unknown costs that come up while putting a record together. =) Everyone who can pledge $25 or more will receive a hard copy of this record.  So don't think you are just donating money here. You will get something for your money. This is the first time I try something like this, but I figure, I have nothing to loose!  I hope you can take part in it.  All my best !  Mike Morenomikemoreno.com"
The Kindness of Strangers|failed|The Kindness of Strangers is a feature length documentary film.In March 2016 we heard the story of Ruth Lachs, a born survivor who was hidden by the Dutch Resistance during the Second World War. Why was she hidden? She was Jewish. Ruth's story is similar to Anne Frank's, the only difference is, she survived. Chaim Ferster was just 17 when the Nazis came and told him and his family to pack their belongings. He survived the war and miraculously 7 different concentration camps.Rick Carrier was awarded the Legion d'honneur for his bravery during the D-Day landings. He went on to discover and help liberate Buchenwald concentration camp.Diet Eman spent the war hiding in the shadows working for the Dutch Resistance. She hid Jewish families and moved people around Holland to safe houses. Diet's selflessness saved countless lives and she still manages to bring an upbeat tone and occasional humour to her shocking stories.Our story has developed into something much larger than a first hand account of the wars atrocities. We have found people who tie the stories together and explain the true horrors of the Holocaust and their lives after.We need your help to take us a step closer to a finished film. We've managed to shoot a large part of the documentary, but still need to interview key contributors all over the world to complete our main subjects stories.We aim to release the film in major international film festivals to give it the platform this subject matter deserves. We want the world to see this film and we're going to ensure it does!Please watch the trailer. This moment in modern history affects us all. Genocide is still common place today.Your kind contribution will help us finish this important film. Thanks.To stay up-to-date with the latest stages of production head over to facebook.com/thekindnessofstrangersdocumentary www.groundbreakproductions.co.uk  We have filmed 5 interviews so far. For some, this might be the last chance they get to tell their story. Our biggest worry is missing out on capturing this testimony.
Maybe It's Poison|failed|"             ""I had the chance to demo this game at Salt Lake comic con and I absolutely loved it! The idea and theme are perfect and the gameplay is really smooth.

Smart Dive Buddy: Smartphone Dive Camera & Computer|failed|" Unfortunately this project was not funded :-(But, we still appreciate the help and the valuable feedback we received from the Kickstarter community.We are still committed to bring this innovative product to the market albeit with a bit less aggressive schedule (most likely by the end of this year).If you are still interested in this product, please follow its progress on our website and/or on its dedicated forum.If you were a backer of this project, we will give You - and only You - the option to purchase a Smart Dive Buddy at the special Kickstarter 's price. And you will receive your Smart Dive Buddy well ahead of anybody else (most likely early October). Contact us if you are interested.According to recent reports, more than 65% of Americans own a smartphone and nearly 50% of Americans participate in some form of outdoor activity. In the 18-24 age group, 43% use their smartphone while participating in outdoor activities.So, if you are young (or young at heart) and would like to, or already do, use a smartphone underwater while snorkeling, free-diving or SCUBA diving, then…Smart Dive Buddy is the evolution of the bluebuddy wireless data logger that we launched on Kickstarter in January 2013.In addition to being a stand-alone dive data logger, Smart Dive Buddy now includes a mode for communicating with a smartphone while underwater via Bluetooth 4.0 low energy technology. (The smartphone must be in a protective housing.) Thanks to the Smart Dive Buddy system, the smartphone can now obtain relevant dive data, such as absolute pressure and water temperature in real-time.This new system is composed of 5 key components: sensor, bracket, smartphone housing, smartphone and app.Of those 5 components, we will provide the sensor, the bracket and the app. (Along with instructions on how to put everything together and how to use it.) You will need your own smartphone and housing.The Smart Dive Buddy sensor, being an evolution of our bluebuddy sensor,  measures absolute pressure and ambient temperature. It is depth rated at 40m / 130ft and contains a 1,000 mA/h Lithium battery. The sensor can be used as a stand-alone data logger or as part of a smartphone dive computer when mounted on the housing using the provided bracket. When used as part of a dive computer system, the sensor measures ambient pressure and temperature every second and sends the data to the smartphone.Because the sensor is continuously communicating with the smartphone, while in dive computer mode, we expect the lifetime of the battery to be about 4 years for a diver performing 50 dives per year (a bit shorter than the bluebuddy’s lifetime). The Smart Dive Buddy sensor comes with a one year warranty. We will also provide a Manufacturer Battery replacement program and a Do-it-Yourself battery replacement kit.The bracket is the device that keeps the Smart Dive Buddy sensor attached to the smartphone housing. The bracket is designed to fit the model-specific smartphone housings that we currently plan to support in this project.We are currently planning to support the following model-specific underwater housings:Bonica - Seashell: SS-i, SS-i5 & SS-GS4i-Divesite - i-Pix: iP4, iP5 & iPS-GS4TAT7: TAT7 for iPhoneWatershot: WiP4, WiP5, Wip5-Pro, WGS3 and WGS4If/when new models of underwater housings become available we will be more than happy to work with their manufacturers to make sure they are compatible with our Smart Dive Buddy device.We are currently planning to support the following model-specific smartphones:Apple: iPhone 4S and iPhone 5 & 5SSamsung: Galaxy S3 & S4We anticipate Smart Dive Buddy to be compatible with any new smartphone that supports Bluetooth 4.0 le technology.The new  Smart Dive Camera & Computer app that we are developing is the core component of this new product. The app has the following operating modes: Digital Camera with Head-Up DisplayAdvanced GaugeFreediving ComputerSCUBA Diving ComputerNitrox Dive ComputerThe basic version of the app (Digital Camera with Head-Up Display mode) is free, while the other modes are enabled by purchasing specific licenses.  More specifically, the app has the following  4 licenses: Advanced Camera: $1.99/Year. Used to enable some advanced camera features such as Zoom, digital color filters, time lapse, AWB.Advanced Gauge/Freediving : $9.99/Year. Used to enable both the Advanced Gauge and the Freediving modes. This level includes the Advanced Camera features.SCUBA Diving Computer: $19.99/Year. Used to enable the SCUBA Diving Computer Mode.  This level includes the Advanced Gauge/Freediving and the Advanced Camera features.Nitrox Diving Computer: $24.99/Year. Used to enable the Nitrox Diving Computer Mode.  This level includes the SCUBA Diving Computer, the Advanced Gauge/Freediving and the Advanced Camera features.A Higher level license includes all the features of a lower level license. As an example, if a user purchases a SCUBA Diving Computer license s/he does not need to purchase the Advanced Camera and/or the Advanced Gauge licenseKickstarter backers will receive a 1 year Nitrox Dive Computer license worth $24.99. (Registration will be required to activate the license.)Additionally, the Smart Dive Camera & Computer app includes a digital compass, a Logbook, a Dive Sites Manager, a Dive Planner and a Dive Analyzer compatible with divePAL.Logs can be saved in the divePAL cloud, exported in DAN DL7 format and shared on social media.								The decompression algorithm used in the Smart Dive Camera & Computer app is based on our implementation of the Buhlmann ZH-L16C algorithm. This is the same algorithm we use in our eDiving SCUBA diving simulator and in our iDive Computer and divePAL apps. For more info on our algorithm please check our blog ""Fine tuning a decompression algorithm"".	We started working on this project almost three years ago. In late 2011 the first prototype of the Smart Dive Buddy housing was made in aluminum and we used it to collect RSSI data in worst case scenarios. In early 2012, once we were convinced that the technology was working reliably, we “upgraded” to a GoPro housing and started working on what would eventually become the bluebuddy PCB. Around the same time, we started working on the Dive Camera app for iPhones.In 2013 we had samples of the first version of the bracket and we made several demonstrations at DEMA 2013 last November in Orlando. Based on the feedback we received at DEMA, we redesigned the bracket to make it more robust and moved forward with the productization phase. We now have several 3D printed prototypes of the bracket that fit the smartphone housings we currently plan to support. We expect to have production units by August.Regarding the Smart Dive Buddy device itself, we already have production units of the PCB and expect to have production units of its casing by early August. Its firmware is a variation of the one used on the bluebuddy, including the addition of a continuous communication mode and several new power management features. We expect to have a production release code by early September.On the app front, our prior work gives us substantial expertise in the design of underwater photography apps. We also have significant experience with dive computers and decompression theory as we are already utilizing a custom version of the Buhlmann ZH-L16C algorithm in our eDving SCUBA diving simulator and in our iDive Computer and divePAL apps. The new Smart Dive Camera & Computer app we are now developing combines our underwater photography and dive computer expertise into a new powerful tool. We now have an alpha version of the SDC&C app for iPhone for internal use and for selected third parties. We expect to have a beta version, for both iOS and Android devices, by September and a production version by early October.Last but not least, earlier this year we executed a licensing agreement with AUP which owns significant patents on the use of smartphones as dive computers.Upon the successful completion of the Kickstarter campaign, we will place production orders for enough kits to accommodate Kickstarter backers. We are also planning to launch a second, larger production lot to support our market launch. After that, we will progressively increase manufacturing volumes based on market demand. LIKE: $1 Reward - We like You too! SUPPORTER!: $5 Reward - Same as above plus we will mention your name on our website. BETA TESTER:  $145 Reward - Get a Smart Dive Buddy before anybody else and help us debugging it. This reward includes a Smart Dive Buddy sensor, a Smart Dive Buddy bracket and a 1 Year Nitrox computer license (registration with DiveNav is required to activate the license). To avoid any doubt, this reward does NOT include the underwater housing for the smartphone; you have to provide it yourself. We will also send project updates and mention you on our site. Must be based in USA. Also, beta testers will need to sign our Beta Tester Agreement.EARLY ADOPTER: $150 Reward -  Be among the first to get your hands on a Smart Dive Buddy. This reward includes a Smart Dive Buddy sensor, a Smart Dive Buddy bracket and a 1 Year Nitrox computer license (registration with DiveNav is required to activate the license). And you save $65. To avoid any doubt, this reward does NOT include the underwater housing for the smartphone; you have to provide it yourself. We will also send project updates and mention you on our site. SECOND BATCH: $160 Reward -  This reward includes a Smart Dive Buddy sensor, a SmartDiveBuddy bracket and a 1 Year Nitrox computer license (registration with DiveNav is required to activate the license). And you save $55. To avoid any doubt, this reward does NOT include the underwater housing for the smartphone; you have to provide it yourself. We will also send project updates and mention you on our site. The two critical areas for this project are the manufacturing of the SDB bracket and the development and testing of the Smart Dive Camera & Computer app.SDB brackets: While we have already completed the designs of the brackets, we are still evaluating vendors and, while we plan to provide them with necessary design documents, there could still be delays in creating production tools, setting up production lines and production test fixtures. To mitigate those risks, we plan to have weekly reviews with the vendors and address any potential issues as soon as we become aware of them.App: While we have substantial expertise both in developing camera apps and with simulations of dive computers, there are inherent risks with combining two different sets of product features into a single product. To minimize development risks, our plan is to perform extensive testing using our eDiving simulator along with real life testing.Additionally, due to the fact that the app relies on third party operating systems (iOS and Android) whose behavior could be unpredictable, we will make sure to inform potential customers that the product should always be used in conjunction with a primary, dedicated dive computer."
Final Fantasy 8 (VIII) - What Happened Next?|failed|Final Fantasy 8 was one of the first great games I ever played; the one I always look back on as that which I hope all others will live up to. And whilst I've played Final Fantasy since, this seems to be the great chapter in FF history that gets forgotten. Squall, Rinoa, Zell and their friends, the brilliant Triple Triad card game, the wide open world where you could travel anywhere once you get the Ragnorak, the Shumi village, Cid and Edea, Laguna, Kiros, Ward and Ellone...hell, even the trading and crafting, use of spells and basics like that were just great! Not too complicated, not too simple, just brilliant.Yet, without providing spoilers (you can still play this on PC, PS1, PS3 and hopefully PS4 soon, so I don't want to ruin it) but this wonderful story ends on a cliffhanger, which never really gets explained. These wonderful characters and story lines are left without an end.That's where I come in. I am an experienced writer and publisher who has just released my latest book, The Day the World Would End, and I'm a huge FF VIII geek (as you can probably tell). I have so many ideas about what happened to the gang, and what should have come next, so the world of Squall and the gang be explored much more fully in a new book.I want to write this all out so we can all carry on enjoying these characters, discover what happened after that final battle, continue the story of Squall and Rinoa, get more of that fun card-related fun from triple triad, etc.This kickstarter is to fund me to go ahead and spend the next year of my life writing it, funding designers to provide illustrations and covers, and making this book perfect to continue the story. And, hopefully, to be the first in a series which we can go on enjoying for years to come.There are few risks involved in such a project, but rather the challenge of channeling all of my creative ability and commissioning talent to draw out the best possible continuing world for Squall and the gang.However, I'm a professional writer, I have commissioned various designs and illustrations before, and have even commissioned books themselves for independent publishers - so I have an eye for what works in a book, what makes them better, and what arcs make a story worth reading.The biggest challenge, I think, will be in being true to the original story. However, I'm extremely experienced with the game: I have played it through multiple times in three different formats, I even own a full set of the triple triad cards in real life such has my dedication been to knowing the world inside out! I am confident in doing a good job with this, and will also fully utilise the relevant backers as consultants in the process.
iPhone Skin Made From Real Apple Wood|successful|Update - June 25, 2012 - The Final Product RevealedPlease check out the latest update to see photos of the final productI've known about Kickstarter for years and have always wanted to launch a project.  I'm sure many of you can relate.  After developing several other projects, I finally decided to go for it with this iPhone skin made from real apple wood.I wanted to keep this project as simple as possible.  Hence, the basic (silent) video and short description listing the main features of the iPhone skin.These iPhone skins are made from real apple wood.  Each skin is unique with its own distinct wood grain.  They are laser cut and measured precisely to fit on the back of your phone.  The camera port has plenty of clearance to allow the camera to function normally.  There is also a relief to reveal the Apple logo.  These iPhone skins are less than 1mm thick, have contoured edges, and a matte finish.  They come with an acid-free, removable adhesive, already applied to the back of the skin.  Also included is 1 sheet of laser cut high tack adhesive.  Please note that these are made for the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S only.More than just a box.The packaging for these iPhone skins convert into a stand for your iPhone just by folding along the score lines.  They can be used in portrait or horizontal modes and can accommodate the cord for the charger.  They are made from chipboard, corrugated cardboard, and repulpable tape, and are 100% recyclable.Funds will go toward purchasing the raw materials(such as wood and adhesives), expendable supplies(such as sandpaper and sealers), packaging material, and shipping.Why Did I Make This Product?I just thought it would be fun to have an iPhone with a skin made from real apple wood.  I searched online but could not find one, so I decided to make one myself.  There were numerous trials on paper, test cuts on cardboard, and adjustments down to 1/1000th of an inch.The ProcessI will be making each one of these skins myself and will not be outsourcing any process.  I buy all of the raw materials and supplies and assemble them. Some of the steps in making these skins include: prepping the material, programming the laser cutter, applying the adhesive, several sanding steps, and finishing.  At this time, I have found that the best way to finish these pieces is to sand by hand and seal each one individually.  It is much more time consuming, but the end result is far superior than finishing my machine.These iPhone skins are easy to apply.  Align the camera port and the relief for the logo.  Center left to right, and top to bottom.  Gently apply even pressure.  Very little pressure is needed to adhere to your phone.  Please note that these iPhone skins are intended as aesthetic only.  Though they may prevent (or cover up) scratches, but they do not protect from damage due to water, impact, or drops.

My Darling June|failed|"The StoryMy Darling June was inspired by a moment in my life, when I felt things weren't the way they were supposed to be going. In a sense it's about disillusionment, and the inability to live up to our expectations. The main character ""Bill"" is going through a mid-life crisis, and he's just completely lost as to why he's in this earth. Some people feel like they have purpose in their work or they touch others in some way with their special gift(s), and Bill is one of those people who has not yet discovered what they are good at, so he feels like an extra piece of a clockwork, as mentioned in Scorsese's ""Hugo"". If we don't have a purpose in this world, it's like we're broken. And Bill is a broken person without anything, and most importantly he is a man without love. He can't bring himself to love or be loved, but he's really trying.Another thing that inspired this short was Buster Keaton movies, mainly ""The Love Nest"", which is this beautiful and funny silent film. It's about a man who has lost interest in the world and sails out to sea and ends up boarding a vessel - it's really great. The entire script is on the link below, it's a very small, and personal short, and can be done very cheaply. I feel it's not the size of the camera or the quality of a production that counts, it's a matter of just telling a story with moving images. The screenplayhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/richtr6eyvfu618/My%20Darling%20June%20%28QOctober%29.pdfOne of my dreams is to turn this into a feature someday, I would make it into a musical, kind of like Vincente Minnelli's ""The Clock"" only with music. I actually think I have pretty great idea for a feature, but that's only a dream for now. So please check out the script, the story really ends as it is about to begin, I mean you can only do so much when you're making a short film, and I felt this moment in his life captured the essence of what romance really is - just an eruption of emotions too big too grasp.One one of the coolest things about this project is that all of the soundtrack scores are being used from collaborators of Joseph-Gordon Levitt's ""HitRecord"" website. http://www.hitrecord.org/ Several amazing members have agreed to share their work for this project. Feel free to browse this website, it's amazing. BudgetI really enjoy making very small and personal movies, which is what this project is all about. I don't need the fanciest camera or a bunch of lights or any of that, that's something else. I wanted to make this short with the smallest crew possible and the minimum amount of equipment. I want to be resourceful and not invest ten thousand dollars on a short film, because I feel that's highly unnecessary, of course that's usually dictated by the vision a filmmaker has. In my case, I'm using about 1k dollars to make this short film, and most of the money will go to equipment, such as camera rental, sound, and some lights. No one is really getting paid to do this, it's all a labor of love, and I'm only asking for 600 dollars, since I'm covering other costs, which is mainly post-production. The PlayersJoshua Thomas Gallegos - I am the writer, director, and producer of this project. I just turned 25 years old a few days ago, and I've done a couple of very small short films, the funny thing about that is I didn't have any actors to work with, so I ended up filming abstract things and just compiled them together, so this will hopefully be my first time working with actual actors, which is great. I've been on some big budget sets, so I have the experience to get this project done. I love films and classic cinema, and I love to talk about them. Below, you will find my IMDB account and my twitter account.

Monster Mob, the fun card game for all the monster family.|failed|We are seeking to create a fun card game, for kids, that can be played by adults too. The game will be really simple to play and will encourage collaboration and taking turns to play, thus helping kids to learn vital skills. If the game is enjoyable, then learning is subconscious.The deck consists of our cute and completely bonkers monster cards (All hand sketched unique monsters with their own names), and the cards that all monsters dread the most ... capture cards.The game is based on chance, it's really simple to play, use the different powers of your capture cards, to win monsters from other players, the person with the most monsters wins.Build your monster army!!!(Age 3+)Its difficult to go into any more detail about the game, without opening myself up for copy cats. Rest assured the game is a unique arty twist on an absolute winning formula, which is tried and tested.The images you see in this project are of a hand made sample we created.We have crafted the game mechanics, and done the art work for the game, we have also had conversations for bulk supply, and have chosen the best manufacturer.Why do we need your backing. We need to create metal plates for printing the cards, we also want to go for a top quality thick material for the cards, combined with a necessary bulk order, which is required to secure our supplier. Unfortunately this doesn't come cheap.
Blacklivesmatter Series|failed|Hello, My name is Pedro Young Hall but I go by Dro Hall and I am an artist from Iowa. The reason why I am asking for donations, is because I have been in the process of creating a painting series centered around the #blacklivesmatter movement. When the movement began I made a trip to Ferguson, MO after the murder of Mike Brown to support the movement. After that initial trip I made multiple trips to Ferguson including one with a group I belong to in Iowa City and I was inspired to take my own action. I am currently getting ready to start a series of paintings  inspired by #blacklivesmatter. Why I believe you should donate, is because of the time, love and dedication i put into every painting. I take a lot of time in each finished painting up to 50 hrs each piece. I'm just in need of funds to purchase supplies, transportation,studio rental cost, and framing. I've also been invited to take part in a art show in Iowa City on March 28th and I would love to have a few pieces finished and framed ready to display.The pieces I create will range from large to small because the black experience isn't viewed in just one way. Any donation would be greatly appreciated. To see more images of my paintings and other work check out my Twitter page @drohallartist or my Facebook page Dro Hall Arts.The only problems that I can see come up is finding a venue after March 28 to display the pieces but I have a few online galleries that would display the art as well. Also I'm currently looking for a venue to show my finished works in St. Louis. Yes I may have PTSD but painting has always been a passion and despite my issues that had never changed so I see no issues with that at all.
Sorensen Glass Studio|successful|We all have dreams that we spend our lives trying to reach. Large or small, our dreams can be just out of reach no matter how hard we work. Wouldn’t a boost be nice?Hot, sharp, and dangerous, blowing glass is an exciting art form. My name is Jeff Sorensen and I live in Minneapolis with my wife and three year old son where I work as a glass artist part-time. Over the past 18 years, I have apprenticed with local artists and traveled the world to study this art form at its origins.Supporting my family solely with my art has always been a dream of mine, but the initial investment has been a major obstacle. However, recently I was given the opportunity of a lifetime to purchase four major pieces of equipment that would help me make the transition into a full-time glass artist.I am seeking $10,000 to purchase this equipment, which also covers installation and delivery.Your support would mean the world to me and my family. It would not only allow me to live my dream, but it would also serve as a means to expose my son to creative practices and let him see his father in action doing something I love. In return for your support, I am offering some great rewards. Hand-blown glass pieces are available at many different levels, anywhere from Christmas ornaments to a private lesson for you and a friend. Make sure to check out all the rewards I am offering in the Rewards Section. If you don’t see something you are looking for, feel free to contact me and I am sure we can work something out.If you are unable to contribute monetarily, please share this page on social media to help spread the word.If you would like to see examples of my work, visit my website at or find me on Facebook.Thank you so much. Your support means more than you can ever know. If my goal is met, I will work hard to make sure this project is successful.

Flutter & Flow Knitting Book|successful|I love lace.I love the exacting choreography of yarnovers and decreases,the way my needles dance through each step, and the all-encompassingconcentration I need to read the chart.  I love the transformative power of blocking a new piece, theelegant sweep of a delicate shawl, the easy drape of a loose front cardigan.I love the feel of lace fabric, the unexpected lightness,how the breeze slips through and makes the edges flutter.But a lot of times, I don't like wearing lace.  I find most lace garments are neitherpractical nor flattering.  For this project, I set out to change that.  I wanted to make a collection of designs thatI would be happy to wear in my everyday life; designs that were elegant &beautiful and ready for action!My challenge was to shape lace to flatter real women, womenlike me, women who value the combination of elegance and action while alsolooking for an adventurous romp in their knitting.  My Flutter and Flow collection contains nineteen uniquedesigns to entertain you, challenge you, and flatter your shape.  The collection includes pullovers, cardigans,shells, tanks, jackets, tees, hats, a shawl, and even one blanket.  (I hope you don't mind that I snuck in alittle home décor among all these garments!) Here are a few of my favorites:   La Vela Tank A gorgeously feminine tank, the La Vela surprises with itsuncommon line of lace tumbling down your back.    Mildred Pierce Cardigan Mildred Pierce, the dedicated mother of an ungratefuldaughter, would find this cardigan perfectly fits into her hardworkinglifestyle.  A hearty lace pattern allowsthe retro thirties vibe to shine in this piece which celebrates your uniqueform.   Erebor Dress The Erebor, a lace dress evoking the simple pine tree,easily slips onto your needles to create a summery form.   Wisteria Wedding Jacket Wedding jackets perfectly fit for a formal event in anyseason.  In the depth of summer, theywarm you in the dark of the evening as you sip your final glass ofchampagne.  The sleeves protect your armson the wintry days.  The Wisteria WeddingJacket warms you without concealing your feminine flair. Mariposa Tunic The Mariposa tunic remains my favorite of thecollection.  The fluttering sleeves andflattering silhouette conceal the fact that it is a joy to wear - socomfortable!While these are my favorites, I'm sure you will find yourswithin the nineteen patterns included in the Flutter and Flow collection.  When completed, these pieces will take youfrom the grocery store to the most formal gala. To see the rest of the collection visit: http://www.theyarnslayer.com/flutter-flow-preorder/ Your support in this effort will allow me to pay my techeditor, my graphic design helper, and print a limited run of books. To thankyou for supporting this effort, I've made a special list of rewards for youincluding copies of the book, special knitting tutoring sessions, knittingkits, and even custom knitted hats and sweaters.  Lace Highway & Jannette's Slouch Kits AvailableAbout MeConventional wisdom dictates knitting is relaxing andmindless. Unfortunately, I’ve never been good at relaxing and mindless. As achild, knitting gave my antsy hands something to do. As I got older, my antsyhands and restless brain searched for harder and harder patterns to conquer.Finally, nothing would do except to invent new patterns myself.These days, the creation of a simple pattern isn’t quiteenough to tame my restlessness. It demands that my designs push the envelope,often beginning with the thought, “Is this possible?” With that, a quest toslay the next dragon begins!Yarn is my favorite tool in this quest, but also my mostgifted adversary. Like my sigil, the ferret, I continually search in familiarcorners to find something new and surprising to challenge me. Also like theferret, my fingers display a joyous dance of war when I discover it.My background includes an M.S. in Textile Engineering fromPhiladelphia University. My designs have appeared in publications includingInterweave Knits, Knitscene, knit.wear, Creative Knitting, Vogue Knitting, andKnitter’s Magazine. My winning knit fabric design was also distributednationally through Urban Outfitters.Through my work as a knitting instructor and yarn guru atPrairie Yarns in Fargo, ND, I enjoy teaching people how to slay their owndragons.The book is already written and proofed, so everything is a go!
Sci-Fi Janitors VS the Redbull Soapbox Race|successful|"We are the Sci-Fi Janitors!!   Bob and Carl first started as a short form puppet piece for a show at Dad's Garage Theater here in Atlanta.   That same year it was decided that Bob and Carl should film a few short episodes with their unique brand of humor/commentary on geek life for the attendees of Dragon*Con, the largest fandom convention in the world.  The Sci-Fi Janitors were an instant success and the boys in yellow decided to keep making episodes in the form of a weekly web series.   When the next Dragon*Con rolled along not only did Bob and Carl return in all their video series glory they performed AND hosted the first ever Late Night Puppet Slam at Dragon*Con having to turn away hundreds at the door due to being over capacity!   Because of this Dragon*Con in 2012 will have their own programming track dedicated to puppetry in celebration of that art form!  The Janitors entered, and were accepted into the Redbull Soapbox Race taking place in Atlanta on June 9th.  The three judging categories are track time, design, and overall presentation.   The great folks at Penny Dreadful Productions are helping us to design and build our car.  It will involve a lot of labor and carving a custom foam shell.  We will be incorporating a very ""Sci-Fi"" theme along with our own ""Janitors"" style of humor and showmanship!    Why do we need money?The plan is to film all the exploits and shennanigans of building and racing a soapbox racer.  All from the point of view of our two favorite puppet heroes, Bob and Carl.  This is a completely different style of shoot for us.  Normally we film in a small green screen studio, but now we are going to be filming on location with a combination of puppets and real people as the cast.   This makes production a lot more complex and expensive.  If we raise the money we need we will release an entire new set of videos to the web based on the story of building and racing the car.  If we get enough footage we want to make a short film and try to release that film at Dragon*Con but in the very least there will be a brand new web series released through our website and other online channels.   Help us get our new web series starring Bob and Carl off the ground with this great opportunity!  And Secondly, and This is ImportantAny funding we recieve over the amount we need for the Redbull filming will go directly to the production of our first ever DVD!   I know our fans have been asking us for a DVD of our collected works and behind the scenes footage and outtakes forever!  Nows the chance to help make that happen!  If we get enough to make the DVDs on top of filming we will make it available to all the donors at a special price!

Secret Behavior Magazine|successful|Secret Behavior is a contemporary art publication focused on the human condition. It is made by empassioned human beings who are on a mission to reveal what might otherwise stay hidden; who intend to sit and stare at truths and experiences that often just vanish. Secret Behavior is full of feelings, flesh and other human stuff. It celebrates beauty, ugliness, desire, mystery and solitude, and recognizes our common and uncommon mental states, physical forms and sexual experiences. Secret Behavior’s second issue is nearly complete and scheduled to launch during the NY Art Book Fair at MoMA/PS1 Queens in September. The issue will consist of 180 pages devoted to the intimacy, beauty and dysfunction of family. This Kickstarter campaign has been created to raise the necessary funds to print our publication at the highest quality possible. As we continue our search for a sponsor who understands our message, connects with our content and matches our financial needs, we are reaching out to our readers and fellow creatives to help us keep Secret Behavior on the book shelves. I have a special place in my heart for this issue of  Secret Behavior since I have been raising a family in NYC for over 20 years.

Michale Graves “Vagabond Acoustic” Extremely Limited Edition|successful|"Project by Michale Graves and Hydraulic Entertainment “This is a true labor of love” The origin of the idea:In November of 2012 Michale launched his first Kickstarter project – the Rock Folk album “Vagabond”. Vagabond was released on February 26th of 2013 and has been incredibly well received by Michale’s loyal fans as well as new fans that have had the opportunity to hear the album. Michale supported the album with the Spring “Vagabond” tour that kicked off at the historic Stanhope House on March 22nd – the tour will run through May 25th of this year.  One of the pledge levels created for that Kickstarter project was a limited number of in-home acoustic performances - Michale has been playing acoustically throughout his career but never in an intimate of a setting as in-home. The first of these events occurred at the residence of longtime fans and friends JoeMisfit and MaggieMisfit,  “home of the JoeMisfit Collection”.During that incredibly touching private performance, Michale began each song with a story of its origin and commentary about the influences that impacted each song. With 15 people within arm’s reach, Michale in the living room and his business partner Mark, sitting on the center hallway steps - the idea for this album – “Vagabond Acoustic” was born. “It was one of the most memorable musical experiences that we have ever had – and the ability to share it with family and friends was simply AMAZING”. - JoeMisfit""The intention of this project is to recreate that experience on one compelling and personal album”Telling the Story of Vagabond AcousticMichale has selected 8 songs from the “Vagabond” album to perform on “Vagabond Acoustic”.

There will only be 300 Hand numbered CD’s at the $20 level and Michale is offering something special for his friends and fans at the $40 pledge level - an ULTRA limited numbered of autographed and number “Vagabond” CD’s. THERE WILL ONLY BE 100 SIGNED AND NUMBERED “Vagabond Acoustic” CD’s. Pledge $175 or more for one of theseAnd being true to the origin of the original “Vagabond” project there are 3 levels of acoustic performances being offered: an in-home event for up to 10 people for $500 plus travel, an in-home performance for up to 25 people for $750 plus travel and a public performance that you promote for $1,000. But there will only be a total of 15 acoustic performances offered with this project – set to be performed during August and early September of 2013.Why Kickstarter? This is Michale’s third Kickstarter project and he feels that this is the ideal platform to pre-sell, promote and interact with his fans. We consistently receive feedback and requests to continue to use Kickstarter so we are very excited about this project. Hydraulic Entertainment Hydraulic Entertainment, headed by CEO Mark Allen Stuart, is a creator, producer and promoter of eclectic film, video, music and entertainment properties. Accessing the finest talent in the business, Hydraulic Entertainment is a vertically integrated company that is comprised of artist/business people throughout the organization. About Michale Graves Michale entered the music scene in 1995 in a huge way – as lead singer for The Misfits . Michale rapidly shifted the band’s music from the Horror Punk style that it originated in 1977 into an Anthem Rock vibe that the band is most recognized for throughout the world. Enjoying US and world-wide acclaim Michale was named the “Number One Vocalist” in Japan in 1999. After a successful run with the band, Michale separated from The Misfits in 2001, and he counts that time as a gift that he will always cherish with love and respect, for the band and all of the fans that experienced the electrifying in concert musical experiences the band created. After the Misfits, Michale formed several bands including Graves where he recorded the “Web of Dharma” album in 2001, Gotham Road “Seasons of the Witch” album in 2003 and his current band, Michale Graves - where he released several albums including “Punk Rock is Dead” in 2005, “Return To Earth” and “Illusions” in 2007, a short film called “The Blackness and The Forest” and a live acoustic record called Illusions Live/Viretta Park in 2008. With each phase in his career Michale has evolved his voice and the musical experiences that he creates. At the center of his music is the consistent tour of venues in the US and throughout the world. Performing for, entertaining and interacting with fans has always been the driving factor for Michale as a performer. That consistent drive has resulting in over 500 in-person performances over the last 5 years. In November of 2012 Michale utilized Kickstarter for the first time in creating the “Vagabond” project which was successfully released on 2/26/13 and was followed by the Spring 2013 “Vagabond” tour that took Michale to 45 venues across the United States. Just prior to departing for tour Michale recorded his first Monster Rock album in many years titled “Lost Skeleton Returns” – and the album has a street release date of 6/14/13. A Note from Michale “When I write all of my music I first compose it in acoustic form. The opportunity to create a unique and intimate experience with this album is so compelling and so original, that I had to make this happen. I hope you enjoy the “in-home performance” feel of “Vagabond Acoustic”.  ~ MichaleThe “Vagabond” full band project has been incredibly well received. The Spring “Vagabond” tour with 45 tour stops has helped in promoting the “Vagabond” voice. We anticipate that “Vagabond Acoustic” will have a very strong following:R/C #1 – An acoustic version of the “Vagabond” album doesn’t have market demand. During the spring tour Michale carved out 4 songs and performed them acoustically. This prove to be the highlight of each performance.R/C #2 – An album that includes acoustic songs with audio background commentary will not be accepted by the fan base. Michale has been performing acoustically for 10 years and each of those performance involved telling the background story of each song.R/C #3 – The goal isn’t met and the CD isn’t produced. We have set the goal at a very low level to insure that the project will be completed and fans rewarded with a diverse assortment of pledge levels.R/C #4 – The concept of the album is interesting but how can Michale’s fans have an in person experience themselves? There is an assortment of pledge levels that include in-home performances by Michale."
Odyssey Skateboards Launch|failed|" Whether it's raining, snowing, or the sun is shining, there is always a skateboard under my feet. My goal is to provide unique skateboards and share my passion with those in my community who appreciate the lifestyle, and like supporting local ventures. My name is Josh Miller and I'm starting a company called Odyssey skateboards. Odyssey began as a small idea when I first moved to Santa Cruz, to share the level of enjoyment I get out of everything that is skateboarding, with the people around me. Odyssey skateboards will utilize an old fashioned silk screen printing process, with all prints being done by hand to make skateboards. Currently I am creating custom skateboards, one at a time, out of my garage, and advertising by word of mouth. I would love to bring my ideas and process to a broader market. In order to do so I will need support from my friends and community in order to reach my goals to turn this creative expression into a sustainable outlet of unique products. I would like to grow my idea from my garage to your neighborhood. My garage workshop includes equipment that I have created from re-purposed furniture, as well as other pieces that I have built and inherited. I would like to turn what some would consider a ""hobby"", into a full scale operation. I am looking to raise money to upgrade my equipment so I can produce these hand made skateboards on a larger scale. I'll need to raise $700 for the necessary equipment I would need, including: wood to make skateboards, a professional exposure unit and a special printer designed for printing transparencies. As a perk, I have included some cool rewards for contributions, including hand produced stickers and t-shirts, as well as the final product skateboards. I'm even offering a day with me in my shop to learn the process and make your own skateboard. I want to thank you all for checking this out, and I appreciate your support.JoshAfter the project is funded, I want to get to work producing the line of skateboards and get them out into stores and circulating throughout the skateboard community. I could encounter shipping delays or experience incorrect order placement from distributors. I will also need to dedicate a lot of time to ensuring that this project is executed correctly and efficiently. As a rule, I make sure to always have several things available to work on, no matter what the situation. If a shipping error occurs and prevents me from receiving an item, I will focus my attention on other aspects of the project until I have successfully corrected the situation. I will also prioritize my time and manage every aspect of the project until it is seen to completion."
PoolPooj|failed|Millions of people have the best fucking idea in the world. Unfortunately, great ideas and our own cheerleading don't make you successful. Sometimes, the person with the crappiest idea and some other jerk who thinks it's great, who happens to have deep pockets, can be enough to take the idea through a few pivots and turn it into something valuable. This story isn't ours.Our story hasn’t been about us knowing some rich angel dude or being some entrepreneur in residence at a VC.

We now need funds to print the book which will be given away as a Gift with Purchase at this national retail brands' store locations in November.

Shoot For Thrill or Shoot To Kill? Political Sculpture|successful|"THE REASON FOR THE PROJECT Over the years,  gun violence and crime across the entire United States has dramatically increased.  Whether it occurs on the street, in homes, or even in schools there is always someone staring down the barrel of a gun and taking lives. This issue is very two sided and leaves much controversy in the offices of politicians and the eyes of society.  There are many in this country who enjoy shooting firearms recreationally, while others stray away from the deadly potential of these weapons. This is the concept and controversy in which I choose to decipher in my undergraduate capstone exhibition. It is a very serious issue in today’s society and I want to bring the intensity to life through the visual arts in a neutral way that not only appeals to viewers but educates them as well. This exhibition will emulate my advanced knowledge of sculpture and art education through a series of six pieces using the assemblage process. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT I will be creating a representation of the American Flag out of nearly 15,000 spent brass bullet shells. The size of the flag will be approximately 4 feet high by 7.6 feet wide.  Each of the shells will be mounted onto a hard wood backdrop using a two part epoxy and then hung for the viewers eye to see. From a distance it will look like a typical american flag, however as the viewer steps closer they will realize that it is made solely from spent shells.For this project I will be using thee different size shells to asset in depicting the values of color in the flag. I will not be painting the shells, rather the orientation of each shell will create each value as seen in the small model below.  By placing the charge end up as seen in the star, it creates a white value. On the other hand, by placing the hollow end up, the residue of gun powder creates a dark value such as a blue or red. TYPES OF SHELLS USEDFor the stars I will be using nearly 1,550 .22mm shells. These shells are most commonly shot by criminals. Below you will find an image of what the .22mm looks like.  The second shell size I will be using is the 9mm which is also commonly shot by criminals. This shell will be used to make up the blue surrounding the stars. There will be approximately 5,000 used. Finally, I will be using the 45 ACP shell to make up the stripes in the flag. These are commonly shot by task forces and federal agencies. There will be approximately 8,500 of these used. Below is an image of the 45 ACP,PREVIOUS WORKTHE PROCESS There are two different methods that I have considered for constructing this massive piece. The first is very simple yet very expensive. Firstly, I plan on purchasing a sheet of 3/4"" thick hardwood and then sectioning it off into three pieces. Then, I plan to input a computer designed file that lays out the organization of each hole into a CNC router. This will then scan the file and drill each of the 15,000 holes into the wood accordingly. After the piece has been drilled  I will epoxy each and every shell into the coordinating hole. Finally, I will affix each section together and then mount the piece on my designated presentation wall. The second process is much more tedious. If the cost of running the CNC is too expensive I plan on creating wood frames for the size of each section. Then I will staple a polyurethane screen to the bottom of each portion. Next, I will have to place each shell individually on the screen. Once all are placed I will lift each section and lay it onto its coordinating background piece of wood which will be lathered in epoxy. I will let each section dry, then remove the frames and affix the sections together.  MY GOAL!Essentially, my goal increating this work is to show people my ability to create a work of art that isboth representational and educational. It is to leave the viewer with their owninterpretation as to what they value and believe in this tragic time of gunviolence and crime. This piece will provide the communitywith a positive aesthetic experience. Additionally, it will develop an experience thatallows the community to support their personal beliefs or even develop astandpoint of their own on this issue. WITH YOUR HELP AND GENEROSITY I can potentially bring awareness and visualunderstanding of this controversial issue. Which, in part, may or may notassist in persuading those above to further evaluate this topic.I want to not only appeal to those who aredisgusted by this issue but to those who also value recreational gun use. I donot plan to take a standpoint; I simply present both sides of the issue andeducate the viewer on the intensity through the visual arts.There are a few issues with this large scale political project that still arise even outside of the funding. The main issue is the over all recognition of the piece and its pathway into the real world.Not only will you backing help my work be completed but it will also bring recognition and awareness to the work and the topic making it much more feasible to launch into the real world. In order to over come this struggle to socialize this piece, I plan to reach out to EACH AND EVERY BACKER and thank them for they help and understand how my work has impacted them.  I am confident that my strong work ethic and passion for this project will guide every obstacle out of way and pursue the piece into societal recognition."

Vagabond: The Search for My Homeless Father|failed|Vagabond.I will be traveling from Missoula, Montana to Olympia, Washington, and possibly to Portland, Oregon. The point of this journey will be to document the effects that homelessness has on the relationship between parent and child while documenting my own personal journey to reunite with my homeless father.My Reasons.The ever-rising number of people in the United States that live on the streets is a concern that affects many. As a member of society, I feel it is my duty to utilize my talent to bring a fresh look at this issue. Trauma.I wish to focus my efforts on homeless people who were once successful in the eyes of many, but then took a turn in one way or another that lead to them being homeless. I also want to examine the relationships between these people and the children that love and miss them.It's Personal.A sidebar of my journey to find my own homeless father will be documented along the way. The last time I saw my father, I was 16. I am 30 years old now. He has been living on the streets for the past decade, moving from place to place. Between 2009 and up to about a month ago, he remained MIA. Last year, my son Lyric and I took a road trip out to see if we could find him. We were unsuccessful.Recently, my father was spotted in western Washington in the Olympic Peninsula, and his whereabouts will be the destination of this journey.Goals.My goals for this documentary are simple. To get as many stories told relating to my topic of homelessness and the effects on the lives involved, and to tell my own related story along the way. I want to open the doors to the problems of homelessness in the northwest using my talents of making film.Needs.As a film student, I have access to equipment that will allow expenses to be lower than most productions. At $5,000, I know that this is the bare minimum to get what I need. I would like to have double that, so the more we can raise, the better the end result. We need money for gas, food, lodging, extra gear, and to pay interviewees. We need to be able to focus on getting the best content. We need your help to make this happen. Here is a rough breakdown of what our expenses might look like:  With a budget of $5,000, we can get a quick guerrilla-style documentary shot, covering a handful of shelters and locations. With a budget of $10,000, we can spend more time on location and we can also add Portland, Oregon to the journey and get an exclusive interview with my personal friend, Charles Taylor Springfield-Smith III, whose own father, musician Bobby Lee Springfield is also homeless in Missoula. Not to mention more perspectives and shelters to visit.Equipment Breakdown:Extra Camera, extra lens, extra camera cards, and a few dedicated, heavy duty HDs are req. for footage to be logged every night, among other filming equipment that we can't get through school connections such as misc., which includes batteries, cables, etc. Gas Breakdown:Vehicle will be provided by DP. Using 15 mpg as a constant, and estimating possible mileage, over 200 gallons of fuel will be needed. Lodging Breakdown:Average cost per night will be $100-150, and we will crash on couches when available. Interview Costs Breakdown:Ideally I'd like to have at least $1500 to cover interview costs. Emergency Fund Breakdown:This is the ‘Just in case’ fund, which will cover auto repairs, extra interview costs, food, equipment, and lodging costs that might arise. The risks and challenges of making this film are ones that I am ready to tackle. I have made this trip before many times, only now we will be filming it. For the most part, I am getting permission to shoot in all of the places I am going to be shooting, and the rest will be public land. I have the proper forms for interview subjects and shelters to sign to hold me free from liability and allowing the making of this documentary. Simply put, I have been planning this out to the last detail with backup upon backup plans. I want this to happen more than anyone.

Each turn you flip the top card of your deck and based on the arrow showed on the card you flipped, the turn will pass to the player indicated by the arrow. Anytime you want, you can shout NO! and play one card from your hand on top of the last card played by the active player!The first player that flips his/her last card wins the game!NO! is a 3-7 player game. you can play up to 14 players with two sets of NO! cards (simply pledge for 2 of them, same shipping cost!).Shuffle the cards and distribute them among the players.

We are dealing with suppliers and we have found the best way to ship NO! to you. But above all, we have lots of ideas!As soon as the project closes, we will finalise the design and start the production.The shipping should be part of your pledge. We did our best to lower your costs as much as possible. For shipments in USA, Canada and Europe you would need to add only $6 CAD to your pledge, whilst for international shipments the supplement is $13 CAD.We would appreciate if you could coordinate a group to purchase in bulk, this would help us streamlining our (and your) resources. BGG and other websites are great for this kind of initiatives!Just choose your reward level, add the cost of any additional copies of the game you may want and make your pledge. NO! is a card game. We have a lot of experience with card games and this is a great advantage for us: we have play testers, artists, designers and a solid network to produce and distribute the game.We expect the main challenges to be the following:(a) From observing other campaigns we have noticed that occasionally a box might arrive slightly damaged. Don't worry: we will ship you a new one if this happens.(b) Depending on the performance of the campaign, it might be that the production will be delayed. We will work hard to avoid this and we will duly inform you if this happens.(c) We're working with our manufacturer and we know perfectly what they need to make a great game. We don't expect major delays (see point (b), but sometimes a few color saturation issues have been raised, therefore the final print might look a tiny bit different than the rendering on this page (e.g. lighter black).Thanks for your trust. You are AWESOME!"
Amateur Prose: A book of poetry, stories and original art.|successful|This is a very personal project to me. The book starts with the first poem I have ever written and it chronologically continues to show the growth as a writer I am very proud of. I am proud of every piece chosen and I have a new energy for this project with the art of Eduardo Herrera. He is a rising talent in the Los Angeles art scene and getting an artist like him means that this book has the potential for great things.You can check out his style on his website: http://illustrateded.com/. I am raising money to pay my talented artist, copy write my material and print my book. Every dollar I raise will go straight to funding my dream of having people read what I have to say. I have worked tirelessly to make sure that every investor in my project will get far more than their money's worth and get to own my book proudly knowing that you helped fund one of your most treasured books. Together we can bring my dream into a reality. Thank you for believing in me. Challenges naturally arise when creating any art. It can be difficult to find the right illustrator to represent your writing and it can be a challenge to layout the book one page at a time and customize every inch of the final product. However, I am lucky to have found the right artist who believes in this project enough that he was able to assist me in the whole design process. So as I launch, most of my obstacles are already overcome. The book you will receive is already laid out and is set to print once I reach my goal.
Little Boy Wonder - A Short Film|successful|Making short films is not an easy task, nor is it cheap. We have an incredibly talented & hard working team of filmmakers, production designers, special effects & makeup artists all working together to ensure that this script is brought to life on screen the way it was meant to be. But without funding, things can prove pretty difficult. Eddie Holecko, our special effects & makeup artist, has the task of creating living, breathing monsters on screen. You can imagine that special makeup and prosthetics are not cheap, but if you want to do it right then there is only one way.Heath Daniel, Carolyn Shannon, and an extensive art department are all working together to renovate my house into a brothel from the 1990s that will be present for over 75% of the film. We really want this brothel to feel as genuine and believable as possible, as if you can smell the cigarette smoke and the dirty shag carpets. This however requires many props, wallpaper, lamps, etc that all add up in costs.Jeremy Peele, our cinematographer, is in charge of camera and lighting for the film. SCAD does not have all of the heavy duty lights and specific gel colors that are needed for the film to have the correct & intended look that we are going for, so part of our funding will be delegated to this department as well.Lastly, everybody has to eat right? Feeding a cast & crew of over 20 people is not simple, but is so necessary. Being on set, working the long hours, creating films, it's what we're all here for, but we all need energy to do it.Why invest in this project? Our team is committed to making a film that will both entertain & engage you, but also a film with substance that will hopefully linger with you after viewing. Making films is not easy or cheap, especially good ones. Please help us turn this script into the living, breathing, vision it was meant to be.This is a short film involving many special effects & hard work, and like I had said before, short films are not easy to make. But I had also mentioned that our team is committed. Whatever we may encounter, it will be conquered. We set out to make this film and that is exactly what we are going to do until it is the final product that we have all been striving for from the very beginning.
JUDGED...The Irreverent Party Game|failed|True friends don't judge each other.  They judge other people...together.Each boxed set contains350 scenario cards100 character cards50 player response cards (5 per player/up to 10 players)HistoryJudged – the Irreverent Party Game was born out of a single phrase tacked up on the family refrigerator by our Italian mother during our formative years. “We are not called to Judge—we are called to Love,” she would often point to and repeat to us aloud.This was usually following a disparaging commentary of the neighbor, the math teacher, the Kmart cashier. Nobody’s perfect. So with years of fighting then forgiving, hitting then hugging, criticizing then caring, let’s just say we were armed with some quality material. What is it?Judged—the Irreverent Party Game was created to bring out the worst in you and your friends.  Who is the most maverick, deviant, odd-ball freak?  You be the judge. Why are we doing it?To laugh more. To put down smartphones.To help you get some.How to play.First, choose 1 person to be judged, usually starting with the most attractive person in the room.  Then, give each player 5 response cards:Next, The Judged flips over a black scenario card and silver character card off the stack, reads them aloud, and places them face up on the table.  Examples of black and silver pairings:Players (except The Judged) quickly choose from their gold response cards the card that best represents how they think The Judged will respond to the pairing and place their card in front them face-down.How to win.After all players have submitted their response, The Judged proclaims their answer.  Players that have matched the response from The Judged earn a point. The first person to 10 points wins. How funding will be used.The money raised will be used to manufacture the game.  In China. Kickstarter Newbies.Shipping time from overseas.Customs can really screw us.Next season of Game of Thrones gets too good.

PHANTOM-LIMBED: A Romantic Comedy|successful|THE STORY:A young writer is given a strict last-minute deadline to finish a script he only recently started working on. The deadline gives him just one day to finish the whole thing. To make matters worse, he finds himself unable to ignore the nagging memory of his ex-girlfriend-- who, in a constant attempt to give him suggestions, further distracts him in the process. In the end, he is forced to make the choice between following the direction of his art, or of his heart.PROJECT ORIGINS AND GOALS:Although I have primarily worked on documentaries, this short narrative will be my debut film. The project is important to me because the story's protagonist deals with a very relatable human problem-- one that I'd like to address and offer a solution to. The project arose from the idea of trying desperately to escape painful thoughts/memories that continue to nudge their way back into the forefronts of our consciousnesses. Such memories could be of a lost love, a friend, a relative, even a pet. Whatever it is, we all know that no matter how hard we try to ignore them, there are times when it's near impossible to push these thoughts from our heads. Dwelling on them can interfere with our day-to-day lives so much that I feel it's important to remind ourselves how to move on, as well as what we need to do to put ourselves back on the right track. I chose to examine the subject matter in the form of a lighthearted romantic comedy because although it's about a rather stressful predicament, there is really a lot of humor to be found in the situation as well, and I think there's value in recognizing that. Once the film has been finished, we plan on entering it into as many film festivals as we can in order to attain the broadest possible coverage. It's a passion project that I have been writing for a very long time (say, 14 complete drafts of the story), and I have been dying to find the right like-minded people capable of helping me get it off the ground. Well, that time has finally arrived.CURRENT PROGRESS:With the film being guided by the hard-working and very talented members of Primitive Productions-- Producer Chris Riley, Direct of Photography Jerome Stolly, and Unit Production Manager David Estrada-- the project is really taking off, and we are picking up speed. Our supporting actor Talib Ali has already signed on to the project, and we will be holding casting sessions within the month. August is being dedicated to securing locations and shooting our test footage to ensure a smooth production come time for the week-long shoot. As of right now, the shooting schedule is set for the first week of October. That being said, we are still heavily in the midst of pre-production: finalizing the script, creating storyboards, hiring actors, scouting for locations, etc. Although we still have loads of work to do, the enormous energy and creative drive couldn't be greater, and everyone is very excited to make the film happen!HOW YOU CAN HELP:Yes, we are moving forward, but the film still needs your help! Essentially, all of the budget comes from the support of those interested in seeing the project adapted to the screen, and we would be more than tremendously grateful for any donations to help fund the project. Every contribution will be spent towards production: Permit fees, location fees, equipment rentals, props, transportation, as well as hiring the best actors we can find to bring the roles to life. Anything helps, and you would be given my absolute most heartfelt thanks!However, if you're unable to donate but would still like to contribute, you can spread the word and inform everyone that the project exists by sending them to this web page, which in itself would be extremely helpful!FINALLY:Thank you SO much for your support! I can't describe how much I appreciate you taking the time to check out this project! I sincerely appreciate all of your help and I can't wait for you to see the finished product! Let's make a movie!
Defenders of the Realm: Minions|successful|"Introduction for new playersDefenders of the Realm (DOTR) was first published in 2010 and has sold thousands of copies worldwide since then.   Created by the wonderfully fertile and imaginative mind of designer Richard Launius, and enhanced by the genius of artist Larry Elmore, DOTR has developed an ever-increasingly larger and loyal fan base.  This Kickstarter campaign is primarily geared to that fan base and generally assumes that Backers will be familiar with the base game of DOTR.  However, Eagle Games recognizes and appreciates that some Backers will not be familiar with DOTR and for them we offer this link so that you can check out the world of Defenders of the Realm and perhaps purchase the base game as an add-on to this Kickstarter project:More Information HereWhat will I get if I back this project?1) You will have your choice of getting from one to four of the expansions of 25 unpainted Minion figures.  Each Minion Expansion will include 5 Elite Minions and 20 Base minions. The Elite Minions are pictured in the video above and the sketches below, along with sketches of the Base minions and  a description of each race. Keep in mind that these are the artist sketches of the figures you will obtain.  The molds have not yet been created as this is the primary purpose of raising funds via Kickstarter for this project.  The molds and resultant figures will be created from these sketches and will thus highly resemble them.  The material used will be PVC resin, the same as that used for the DOTR Hero Expansions (also available as an add-on in this campaign).  The factory that produces the Minion Expansions will be the same as that used to produce the Hero Expansions.  The 25 Minions (per expansion) that you will receive will each be in one solid color (i.e. the Orcs will be green, the Undead black, the Dragonkin blue, and the Demons red).2) You have the opportunity to purchase Additional DOTR items --some never produced before, including:   a) The QUEST deck -- 84 standard-sized (3.5"" by 2.5"") cards, including 23 from the original game, 9 from the Dragon Expansion, and 52 that are brand new!    b) The MAGIC GATES pack of five 3D plastic magic gates to replace the 2D tokens used in the original game! 3) You will get any and all stretch goals we reach for free if you have pledged at least $45 (of any sort) to this campaign.  Later on (post Kickstarter) they will only be available for an extra cost as an expansion.4) You may purchase the base game of DOTR; or the Hero Packs; the standalone Defenders of the Realm: Battlefields Game; or even painted versions of these Minion Packs; as add-ons to the basic Minion Pack campaign.Orc Minions: The Orc Minions are made up of large numbers of savagewarriors and swift Wolf Riders that swarm over the Realm. Although weaker incombat than the Demons, Undead, or Dragon Armies, their vast numbers can leadto a quick Dark Lord victory if not kept in check. The elite Wolf Riders roamthe realm making the movement of the Realm Troops and Heroes difficult,disrupting Hero Quests and attack plans. The Orc Minions Pack provides theplayers with 20 Orc Warriors and 5 Wolf Riders, along with the Minion Cardsdescribing how these Minions are to be used in playing Defenders of the Realm. Undead Minions: The Undead Minions are the mostterrifying troops of the Dark Lord’s Army. The most numerous of the UndeadMinions are the ferocious Skeleton Warriors raised from the dead by powerfulnecromancers, terrifying the inhabitants of the Realm as they march unceasinglytoward Monarch City. Riding in support of the Undead Skeletons are terrifyingNightmares, heartless creatures raised from the underworld, riding flamingstallions as they terrorize the villages and cities throughout the Realm. TheUndead Minions Pack provides the players with 20 Skeleton Warriors and 5Nightmares, along with the Minion Cards describing how these Minions are to beused in playing Defenders of the Realm.Demon Minions: The Demon Minions are foul and corruptcreatures primarily made up of grotesque Gluttons; bloated creatures that feedoff the land, destroying all life and consuming the mana from the Realm as theytrundle toward Monarch City. In combat, the Gluttons attack using their longspike-like claws to skewer their enemies and pull them into their giganticrazor-toothed mouths, feeding upon their enemies the way they feed upon the Realm.Deadlier than the Gluttons, the Blood Demons charge into battle wielding aflaming sword that not only burns the body, but corrupts the soul as well. TheDemon Minions Pack provides the players with 20 Gluttons and 5 Blood Demons,along with the Minion Cards describing how these Minions are to be used inplaying Defenders of the Realm.Dragonkin Minions: The Dragonkin Minions are made upprimarily of the brutal Dragonkin themselves. These ancient creatures are half-man/half- dragon, with hard-scaled skin that deflects arrows and blades in combat-- makingthem the toughest warriors of the Dark Lord’s very formidable army.  Controllingthe Dragon-Kin are the Dragon Mages, powerful wizards casting ancient DragonSpells to protect the armies of the Dark Lord. The Dragonkin Minions Pack providesthe players with 20 Dragonkin Minions and 5 Dragon Mages, along with theMinion Cards describing how these Minions are to be used in playing Defendersof the Realm.You get FREE Stretch Goals--when we reach these Funding Levels  they are Unlocked and FREE to you if you have pledged at least $45 in total pledges (of any sort) for this campaign!$28,000 - Unlocked ALTERNATE MINION CARDS - These cards feature different, harder abilities for the base game Demons and Dragonkin.$31,000 Goal - UnlockedALTERNATE MINION CARDS - These cards feature different, harder abilities for the base game Orcs and Undead.$34,000 Goal - UnlockedDemon and Dragonkin Darkness Spreads Monarch City raid cards.$37,000 Goal - UnlockedOrc and Undead Darkness Spreads Monarch City raid cards.$40,000 Goal - UnlockedInn Raid and Move any General Darkness spreads cards.$50,000 Goal - UnlockedLegendary Deck - an ALL-NEW Deck of cards to add new abilities to the heroes!  This is a 16-card pack.$55,000 Goal - UnlockedGlobal Effects Deck - This is a 9-card pack reprinting the Global Effects Cards inside the out of print Dragon Expansion.$60,000 Goal - UnlockedAlternate Orc General - This Goal is for a new Orc General miniature and General Board!  NOTE the BGG contest running now to name this General!$65,000 Goal -- UnlockedTwo New Darkness Spreads cards: Realm in Flames.

Players roll 7 specially designed dice, and can choose whether to focus on grabbing treasure (from the dragon or from another player), fighting the dragon, protecting themselves and their treasure, or running for the exit. Try not to draw the dragon’s attention as you make your way, and note that your fellow adventurers may hinder (or aid) you in your strategy and that the final scoring changes depending on how the game ends, so watch your Dragon Rampage is a strategic dice game for 3 to 5 players.

Defenders of the Realm: Minion Expansion will be produced using the best printing, box and components available. Thanks for your support of Eagle Games and the Defenders of the Realm: Minion ExpansionsPlease direct any questions to: customer-service@eagle-gryphon.comWhy should I back this Kickstarter project?We realize that some of you think that Eagle Games, being a well-established and reliable company, and that Richard Launius, being a well-respected and accomplished designer, should not necessarily need to raise money on Kickstarter for such a project.  However, there are many risks and challenges in the games publishing business, and we want to take on these challenges sensibly.  There are numerous companies that cannot handle these challenges and there have been some spectacular failures recently. Eagle Games has been around for more than a decade (and we intend to be around for a good deal longer).  To us it makes no sense to spend the many thousands of dollars required to produce molds and miniature figures unless there is clearly demand for this product.  So that is the primary reason why we are running this Kickstarter campaign--to establish that sufficient demand is there to warrant this production.  To make it worth your while to help us out, we want to make sure that you realize:1) When the Kickstarter campaign is over and the product is available, we expect the MSRP for each Minion Pack to be $30.  You are able, via this KS campaign, to get each mini-pack for as little as $20 each.2) When this Kickstarter campaign is over and the product produced, the Stretch Goals that you are getting for free will be sold separately as an expansion.  We do not have a firm MSRP in mind yet for these but it will likely be $10 or more.  Also, this expansion may not be available for an additional 6 months or so to the mass market, so think of this as a ""Kickstarter Exclusive Release"" to Backers only.3) You have the opportunity to buy Add-Ons for much better than MSRP prices by buying them now via this KS Project.4) You get FREE shipping if you are in the USA.  If you are in Canada or another international location, you get the ""American subsidy"" for shipping plus the best rates that we can arrange for you.We really appreciate your support via Kickstarter, it helps us a great deal with decision-making and covering the big production costs involved in producing molds and miniatures.Thanks--Richard Launius and the Eagle Games teamThe DOTR Minion Expansions are relatively small. One, by itself, will fit into a USPS Small Flat Rate box tightly--and that's a good thing.  That costs $6 in the US.  We pay this and send those to you (if you are in the US) for ""free"".Canada In Canada, we plan to send all the Canadian Backers' orders to one single person or company that would agree to having us send all copies to them and then out to individuals.  Assuming this works we still need to pay for shipping all the games to Canada, and customs, and the costs of internal-to-Canada postage and materials, as well as some labor to actually send these out.  So please add $16 (for the first pack) for shipping if you are a Backer in Canada. And add $3 for each additional pack in the same order delivered in Canada. So that is $25 for shipping a four pack to Canada.Germany and other EU countriesUnfortunately the small size of the Minions Pack does not help us in the EU -- where the rates for us to send anything from .1kg to 5kgs are all the same.  That is great for bigger and heavier games but not for the DOTR Minions.  So we have arranged to send the DOTR Minions and related products  internal to Germany to an individual in Germany who will send them out, and that allows us to tell German backers that they can add $16 to their pledge for the first game sent to an address in Germany and $3 for each additional game sent to that same address.  So that is $25 for shipping a four pack to Germany.The Netherlands is also an exception because our warehouse is located there.  So shipping the four pack of minions within the NL costs only $22.The EU other than Germany If we can find someone in France, Italy, Spain, and other countries that multiple backers might live in then we need to know that.  Otherwise we will use our warehouse in The Netherlands to send out all EU orders.  And these orders will cost $22 added to each pledge for shipping for one pack and an additional $3 for each additional game. So that is $31 for shipping a four pack to a country in the EU.AustraliaThe rates to Australia are the same as those to Canada because of a new relationship we have with a distributor in Australia.  So add $16 for the first game and another $3 for each additional game. So that is $25 for shipping a four pack to Australia.Elsewhere in the WorldFinally, if you live somewhere other than Canada, Germany, the EU, or Australia, please add $30 for shipping the first game to you and $5 for each additional game to the same address. So that is $45 to ship a four pack anywhere else in the world. We realize that shipping is expensive and we do not like paying this amount any more than any of you do either.  We do subsidize shipping expenses, and we certainly do not profit from them at all.  Thanks for your understanding.Eagle Games has participated in 20+ successful Kickstarter projects completed in 2011, 2012 and 2013, and all of our projects have shipped out either in the same month we originally projected or within 30 days thereafter. Even so, there are always unpredictable events which can occur that might delay our projects. We will do our best to avoid them, but there is always the risk that the project might be delayed. Shipping can be a particularly difficult challenge when it involves destinations outside the US (and sometimes even within the US as well). We will obtain tracking information when it is possible, but sometimes it is not. We cannot guarantee that there will not be shipping problems as we cannot guarantee the service and reliability of the various postal services involved around the world. You will have to assume that risk along with us. We have been producing board games for over 10 years and we have a good reputation for the quality of our productions because we visit and choose our Chinese partners/factories carefully. However, mistakes happen occasionally that we cannot control--such as missing or defective components. When they do, our customer service department will work with you to take care of production problems that might arise. Please contact us with regard to any such issues within 90 days of receiving your copy of the game."

The Undoing Trilogy|failed|"In the summer of 2009, Director Dennis Post and producer/musician Trevor R Todd met at their favorite taco joint. It had been years since they saw one another, and they immediatly started to write ""The Undoing"". Within 30 days the film was premiering at the local historic theater, ""The Crest"" to rave reviews. The sold out premiere featured a film made with ZERO budget, as if born out of pure proactivity. It was the first part in a 3 part feature length work. If we could do this with ZERO budget, just imagine what the funded ""Undoing Saga"" will look like.

The Guardians of Salus: Book #1 in the Halix series|successful|About this projectIt came to me first as a vivid dream, and has manifested into a 3-year project I have developed a deep passion for.My novel, “Guardians of Salus,” is a tale of perseverance and overcoming your past; of learning to fight for the great good. It is representative of everything I stand for and I have been granted the opportunity to have it published.I am reaching out to you today, to help me gain the funds I need to make my dream of becoming a published author come true. I have provided an excerpt from “Guardians of Salus” and I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it.Excerpt from Guardians of Salus:“Dead!”	The word echoed around my head on that day, a long time ago in my twentieth year. It was the same word that woke me up every morning. The same word that took me into my nightmares at night. The voice never changed either. It was the same voice as my father, the day he told me that my mother was dead. My eyes flew open as I sighed, looking towards my clock on the nightstand. It was still blackout time, and I couldn’t hear the whir of electricity running through the room. I reached for my clock and tapped the light button, illuminating the face; 6:00am. Perfect, my favorite time of day.  I swung out of bed and walked towards the window; gently pulled back the thick dark curtain and looked outside. Morning light was starting to penetrate the horizon. I got dressed in the dark, pulling on sweats, a t-shirt, and a sweatshirt. Grabbing my tattered old running shoes, I carefully made my way downstairs, trying not to make any noise so as not to wake up Dad.  Once outside I threw up my hood, and breathing deeply let the fresh air fill my lungs. I stuck my wireless earphones in my ears, turned them on, and let the music wash over me. My feet started pounding the pavement as I took off.	I loved running. Feeling my feet hit the ground, the wind sailing past me. My Mom used to tell me that I was running before I was even walking. She said one day I just stood up and took off. 	I ran as fast as I could away from my house, a place I liked to leave behind. It was big and splendid, and was steeped in family history. But to me it was a burden, a standard I had to live up to. So I left it behind to enter into the neighborhoods that weren’t as grand, but felt more real. I looked at the row of identical houses stretching in front of me. All made from wood, with stairs leading right up to the door from the sidewalk. Narrow fronts, two stories tall, and a narrow driveway to the right side of the structure.  The monotony of my county is still a vivid picture in my mind. I used to run this route every day, soaking in the moments I had there, for I knew it was a limited time. The sameness was a comfort to me. It spoke of peace, of tranquility. It reminded me of my own insignificance. Thinking about others stopped me from being stuck in my own head, a dangerous place to stay.  As I passed the wooden village I emerged into the Town Square, the next reminder to me of the world I could have lived, the place I wanted to leave behind. The Town Square was literally a square, with a large fountain in the middle. Shops on each corner, and at the tip of the square stood the massive Justice Building, with its white marble pillars, neat rows of windows, and majestic façade. It spanned about 100 yards wide, and even farther back. Behind it hid the place that I longed to run from, the place I never wanted to be: The Governor’s mansion; my home.  I lived in Salus, a refuge city divided into four counties; Potentia, Ager, Industria, and Contego. I lived in what was called Central, the governing district of Potentia, really the hub of the city. I was the son of the Deputy Governor, a man with a life sentence. Salus was all I’d ever known. It was beautiful and full of life. But even the most beautiful places can have the darkest secrets. I think I felt it, even then, the darkness that resided in Salus, that would soon take over everything we thought we knew. There is a possibility that I will not make the funding for this project, but rest assured your money will not be taken from you if that is the case. As well I'm still unsure as of yet when publication will be, but as soon as my editor starts her work I will have a better idea and let you know of any changes or obstacles.
Blakes Burgers|failed|Both current restaurants in my city specialize in unhealthy food.  Children go there with there parents and eat greasy, heart stopping food while being bombarded from cigarette smoke since the restaurants allows smoking indoors.I would like to create a healthy alternative for them to dine.  A place that serves healthier food and DOES NOT allow indoor smoking.I started a kickstarter account becauseI need funds to secure a location and get the equipment I need tostart a kid friendly and heart healthy restaurants.  Currently I have3k that I have saved from me working but at my current rate it willbe years before I have saved enough.Please join me in creating a placewhere people can dine without the constant cigarette smoke andunhealthy choicesThere are many risk and challenges that come from opening your own restaurant, however I am prepared to do whatever it takes to create a healthy place for my community to dine.
Build a traditional tipi.|failed|I'd like to make and live in a tipi. I want to build a tipi as a creative way of building non traditional housing. I want to show that it can be done and living in a tipi can be a viable alternative to living in modern houses. I want to share the tipi experience by taking it to festivals and hosting meals inside.The biggest challenge is harvesting the wood for the poles.
The Legend of White Woman Creek|successful|The Legend of White Woman Creek is a one woman folk opera created and performed by Katie Hartman, and created and directed by Nick Ryan. Since its premiere at the 2012 Twin Cities Horror Festival, we have performed the show for audiences in New York, Minneapolis, Cincinnati, Kansas City and Edmonton, Canada and have been overwhelmed by the response from patrons and critics alike.One of our goals with The Legend of White Woman Creek is to record an album of the thirteen song cycle and we are excited to announce that we have scheduled studio space in New York City to begin the process. Our goal is to have a studio quality album with professional recording, mixing, mastering and printing to offer our audience at future tours and performances... but we can't do it without your help!There are numerous costs involved with the production of an album:$1000 Studio Space/Recording/Mixing$500 Mastering$650 CD Printing$150 Shipping/Online Distribution$250 Project FeesWe are off-setting the initial costs by pre-selling both physical and digital copies of the album exclusively through Kickstarter. By pre-ordering you will not only be easing our up front costs, you will also be the very first to receive an album of The Legend of White Woman Creek. Thank you so much for the support!And here is a little taste... We recorded this demo version of Kansas Suitor last year on a home recording set up (with the invaluable assistance of Ashkon Davaron). With your help we'll get a professionally recorded, mixed and mastered version by August!        .soundcloud .card {          max-height: 250px;        }        .soundcloud .embedly-card iframe.embedly-card {          height: 220px;        }        .card iframe[title~=SoundCloud] {          height: unset;        }      Art by Nicole Handel, Video by Brant Miller Recording in a studio is a completely different beast than performing a live show... What works on stage does not necessarily work in the booth and vice versa. Luckily, we are enlisting the help of sound engineer Stanton Nash to guide us through the recording and mixing process, ensuring that we will deliver the highest quality recording possible.Other challenges include potential delays in mastering, production and securing online distribution... We will make sure to communicate and update our Kickstarter contributors every step of the way to ensure on-time delivery of the album.
To Develop A New Worlds Hottest Chilli.|failed|"Hi there, my name is Jason and I am an avid lover of science and spicy food!Have a look at this mad video I made a few years ago. I was taste testing my first harvest of SUPER HOT chillies!MissionMy mission is to grow a new ""Super Hot Chilli"" that will break the world record, currently the 'Carolina Reaper' which rates at an average of 1,569,300 Scoville Heat Units (SHU). Creating A New VarietyMy vision is to selectively breed a new variety of ""Super Hot Chilli"" that after a careful and methodical process will develop into a stable strain. My aim is produce a completely new variety of pepper and have it scientific tested with the aim of breaking the current world record 1,569,300 Scoville Heat Units (SHU). I currently have five varieties of stable strains developed here in Australia, South America and the USA. These will be used in developing this new strain. Due to the type of varieties used, (and not disclosed), there is no risk that someone can produce this variety before me.I will be focusing on healthy plant development, this includes high yielding plants, resistance to disease and of course heat.In order to reach a stable strain of new chilli, I will need to grow approximately nine generations of the new variety, After nine generations I will have something very likely to be 100% stable, as the two sets of chromosomes in the new variety become almost  homozygous. In order to create a healthy genetic pool I will be starting with a wide and diverse number of plants, by doing so this will allow my variety plants greater resistance to some inherited disease. Selective breeding for several generations is definitely time consuming, but necessary if I want to claim a truly new variety of capsicum. Much, much more work, but better quality plants.Please note I do not use pesticides. For the past 4  years of growing I have never used pesticides on any plants. How Will I Spend The Pledges?The kick starter proceeds will be spent on the following,250 pots500 seeds.Approx 3 cubic meters of high grade grade organic matter Large potting table (Second hand) Grow Box, including lighting for 24 hour a day growing. Irrigation systemsElectricity/ water costs I expect to spend one to two hours a day on this project until I have completed 8 generations (1200 hours)My pledge goal does not cover all the costs as I believe it is only fair that I also contribute costs to the goal of creating the worlds hottest chilli.After much thought, I believe these are relevant risks.Disease/ PestsCross contaminationGrowth delays to complete the required number of generations to create a stable strain.Fruit with small quantities of seedsI believe I can mitigate these risks by daily monitoring of my plant stock and starting with a wide genetic pool to limit inherent disease.Cross contamination can be eliminated as I have a designated growing location free from other varieties that can cross pollinate.The use of grow boxes will allow for 24 hour a day growth. This can speed up the growing process- reducing the time to grow up to 10 generations. I will also only be selecting pods with an acceptable number of seeds per pod."

Second Scene Culture City Project|failed|2nd Scene/Culture City: The history of Chicago's local hip hop scene.IntroductionI have been a lover of hip hop culture for a long time.  As I got older I noticed how my feelings about hip hop became more complicated.I started a blog  called alwaysabgirl to examine these feelings about hip hop and aging.All that talk about aging got me thinking about hip hop history and who was telling those stories.  It also got me thinking about how we wouldn't be here to tell it ourselves someday. While researching literature and hip hop history it became glaringly apparent that all of it focused on the west or east coast and that left a great many areas with no recognition.  History is written by those who take ownership of it.  If Chicago's rich and growing scene is to be documented, we are going to have to do the work ourselves.  Anyone who is a part of the scene can tell you, that is what we have always done, create a new path for others to follow.I am a long time member of the local scene and as such I see the gap in knowledge about Chicago hip hop on the national scene and locally.Now is an excellent time to begin the process of collecting stories and artifacts. This is our project's focus, collect the stories while we are still young enough to tell them as it happened.An oral history project is of course the most appropriate way to document the Chicago scene since the art of the emcee follows in the tradition of the griot, the ancient and masterful storyteller.  The documentation of the local scene will also be maintained with the help of a digital online archive that will include video as well as stills of artifacts.  It will be readily available, scaleable and self sustaining. The fifth element of hip hop is knowledge.  Preservation of all of its history is critical to the culture. The project seeks observers and participants of the Chicago scene hiphop scene from 1970s until the present.  We seek input from all MCs, B-Boys and B-Girls, Graf writers and DJs,  Activists, Club Owners, Promoters and Club Goers.  The project has three parts: 1) an oral history, 2) serial documentary and 3) online digital archive to document the Chicago hip hop scene from inception until present day.  Ideally we would also like to develop a 4) fourth piece in the form of a physical building to house the archive.  This space would be a place for research, classes and enjoyment by the hip hop community at large: researchers, academics, youth and purveyors of the culture. The serial video documentary will act as an overview of Chicago's hip hop history.  Ideally we'd like to do one for each decade until the current period ending in 2010. The next sequence would begin in 2020.The video oral history portion will house in-depth interviews/profiles of members of the local community from each era and would cover not only participants in the four elements of hip hop culture, but would also include those in the business of hip hop i.e, club promoters, store owners, producers, writers, etc...The development of an online searchable digital archive where videos, photos, primary and secondary documents and artifacts will be accessible and downloadable for a small fee in order to keep the project sustainable and scaleable into the future and beyond our creation and leadership.  Now clearly the size of this project is massive.  We are only asking for enough to get us started.WhoTherese Ferguson has a MPA with a Non Profit focus and BA in African American studies from Roosevelt University.  She has focused the last five years of her career in the education and culture non profit arena.  She is also a  former promoter and spoken word artist. She did a short stint at Chicago Rocks Magazine as a writer and fashion editor.  Currently she blogs about hip hop and aging and women in hip hop though not necessarily in that order. She believes in hip hop as a vehicle for protest and to get the party started.Oscar Arriola has been documenting graffiti and street art since the late 1980's and worked as a photographer for Chicago Rocks magazine. He curates art exhibitions in Chicago and shows his photographic work nationally. He writes about Chicago art at www.fotoflow.blogspot.com.  He mostly tags photos, not walls.Stephanie Graham is a visual artist living and working in Chicago.  Her personal work draws on her fascination with subcultures, social class, and suburbia. She holds a BA in Cinematography and Photography from Columbia College Chicago. Her love of hip hop started with blasting Crucial Conflict while sipping slurpees in front of the drive way in the suburbs. Stephanie is honored to be one of the photographers selected to make a series of portraits of Chicago's finest, artists not officers that is.Abra Johnson has Master’s Degree in Sociology from DePaul University.  Currently, Ms. Johnson is a sociology faculty member at Malcolm X College. Ms. Johnson also teaches  Racial and Ethnic Groups in U.S. within the DePaul/City Colleges of Chicago Adult Bridge Program.  Her scholarly interests primarily include the intersections of race/ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and class at the site of mass-mediated popular music genres (particularly hip-hop and house music genres and subcultures) in the United States and abroad.  Having spent the last four years both teaching sociology and creating performance art, she is deeply fascinated by these convergences that coalesce into both a creolized national language and a meta-cultural dialogue. Word.HowYour donations will act as seed money to launch the project:  Purchase video/sound equipment for the oral history and documentary portions of the project and the architectural development of the future online digital archive.    A digital archive that will house the history out live us, but not its usefulness.  So What Now?Now that you've listened to our story.  It is our hope that you agree that the history of  Chicago hip hop is relevant to the historical context, growth, expansion and impact of the culture.  We need you to donate, donate and donate. It's an all or nothing game folks.  In truth we have set the bar low here because the way Kickstarter works is you raise it all or you get nothing.  However, the project sure could use more than the 12,000.00 we have listed here.  Tell your friends, tell your enemies, tell mama and 'nem. Give us your beer money!  You know who you are. We sure would appreciate it. Review the various donation amounts and give what you can.  We'd gratefully and humbly take any amount you can spare and in return you get to tell a cool story,  help make history and get a fresh reward.  Thanks for taking the time to review and hope to hear from you soon!  Peace.
Agrandissement de la brasserie|successful|Nous, avons commencé cette aventure avec passion tout en restant objectifs sur notre volume de production. Nous avons progressivement augmenté notre production car la demande augmentait également. Ceci, grâce aux médias, le bouche-à-oreille mais surtout vous, clients. Nous brassons avec passion pour la région et ailleurs et ceci, à côté de notre travail. Nous réinvestissons chaque franc dans notre production, élaboration de nouvelles recettes, publicité et manifestations.Cette année est marquée de plusieurs changements positifs. Changement d'identité visuelle, déménagement dans des locaux plus grand, aide supplémentaire par des bénévoles et notre participation à la World Beer Cup 2016 à Philadelphie. Ce changement est nécessaire afin de permettre à nos clients de venir à notre rencontre et déguster nos produits et visiter lors de brassins. Nos locaux seront plus grands, ce qui permettra non-seulement d'accueillir plus de visiteurs mais également plus de cuves de fermentation. Nous devons répondre à la forte demande qui augmente, et nous atteignons nos limites. Nous avons besoin d'acquérir deux cuves de fermentation 625 litres supplémentaires. Soyez acteurs de notre développement. Nous vous remercions de votre soutien que vous nous témoignez depuis nos débuts.Cet agrandissement est calculé en fonction de la demande qui est en croissance dans un marché qui était dominé par les grandes industries. Nous les artisans, sommes convaincus qu'avec votre aide, nous arriverons à inverser la tendance, ce qui est déjà le cas dans plusieurs pays (ex USA et Canada). Nous vous garantissons que grâce à votre contribution, Bières&Co. verra augmenter sa production, et peut-être un jour, emploiera des personnes qui seront fières de fabriquer votre boisson de la région. La bière est une question de goûts, mais quand elle est fabriquer avec passion, elle est bien plus qu'une bière artisanale.
GO FAR: The Christopher Rush Story (2)|successful|(To learn more about this film, please visit www.gofarmovie.com)VIEW ADDITIONAL VIDEO FOOTAGE HEREGO FAR is a work-in-progress documentary about the life of Christopher Rush, an amazingly inspirational human being who was born with muscular dystrophy. Rather than give up, he defied every expectation and lived a life full of happiness, optimism, and endless accomplishments that most able-bodied people would be proud of. Despite having been diagnosed with a life expectancy of two years, he lived until shortly before his 31st birthday.During his last few months Chris developed an inspirational program called GO FAR (Goals, Obstacles, Focus, Act, Review) that he planned to teach to others who were disabled, troubled youth, and anyone else who needed encouragement and a better path to reaching their goals, regardless of the obstacles. This documentary will serve as his legacy...his message of enduring optimism and hope.My journey to make this film began in 2007 at Christopher Rush’s funeral service. It was there that I first heard of Chris’ GO FAR inspirational program. And after hearing so many amazing stories about who he was and what he accomplished, I knew that Chris’ story needed to live on to inspire more people. Since then I have raised over $30,000 through various fundraising efforts (including a previous Kickstarter campaign), and I have shot over 35 hours of interview footage, as well as the service where Chris’ ashes were spread in the Cayman Islands.Now the real work begins. I have spent months gathering family photographs, archived home movies, professional video footage from MDA, and I have hundreds of pages of interview transcriptions. I have found the perfect editor to work alongside me. I have a DVD distributor who has deals with Amazon, Target, Wal-Mart, and various other national retailers. And I have a schedule that will hopefully have a cut of the film ready by August 12th, 2012 - the 5th anniversary of Chris’ death. What I don’t have is the funding to keep going. That’s where you come in.My GOAL: To raise $5500 to fund the beginning of the editing process. My hope is to edit the first 20 minutes of the film and use that as a tool to raise the remainder of the film's post-production budget through angel donors.My OBSTACLE: I only know so many people and many of them have already made generous donations. So I'm counting on you to spread the word and help me find new supporters!My FOCUS: To raise an additional $25,000 from angel donors which will fund the remainder of the editorial budget, and have a finished cut of the film to screen on Aug 12th, 2012...the 5th anniversary of Chris' death.ACT: This is the step where you come in. I can't do it without your support. Any help is appreciated, and the list of REWARDS is to your right.REVIEW: A donation to this film means we're one step closer to spreading Chris' message of optimism and hope. That is something tangible you can own - the feeling you get knowing you're helping others who will receive this message.I am confident this film will inspire people to overcome obstacles and achieve their goals.**ARTICLES ABOUT THE PROJECT**Idea Mensch ArticleBig Hollywood ArticlePlease feel free to forward this message to friends and share it on Facebook or Twitter.

Esquilo: Simple IoT Development - WiFi + Web IDE + Cloud|successful|"Check out the nice article on Esquilo just posted to Make Magazine...Esquilo is all about making it simple to create connected devices for the Internet of Things (IoT). Everything you need to develop is built-in to the Esquilo hardware.  No cloud required.  You get a complete development system in the palm of your hand.  Just point your browser at Esquilo and go!Check out our extensive technical documentation for detailed information.你需要支援 HTML5 的瀏覽器才能查看此內容。播放打開聲音重新播放帶聲音播放00:0000:00No cloud required.  The web-based integrated development environment (IDE) is stored in Esquilo's flash memory and served to your web browser by your Esquilo over Wi-Fi.  There is no dependency on an external cloud site unlike other web IDEs.  You do not need a connection to the Internet to program and debug your Esquilo, just a browser and a computer.The web IDE includes a full source debugger that helps you find and fix software bugs in no time.  You can click on the source code to set break points, step through code, add watch variables which dynamically update; and inspect the call stack for a function.The command console allows you to enter program statements for immediate execution on Esquilo.  This is great to try out a new bit of code, set or display variables while debugging, or to test out new hardware.  You can also use it to display output and read input from your programs.The cloud is not required to use Esquilo but we provide easy and secure cloud access if you want it.  You can securely access your creation from anywhere with Esquilo's secure TLS tunnel and the Esquilo Nest site.  Just point your browser to your Esquilo's custom URL on the Esquilo Nest, enter your account password, and you are securely connected to your Esquilo from anywhere.  You can do anything through the secure tunnel that you can do with a local connection.  Esquilo's secure cloud access is designed to evolve as new IoT protocol standards do, and since it is based on a secure tunnel, you can use any protocol to communicate easily and securely with your application.The Esquilo Nest site also has a convenient interface to manage your Esquilos.  Forgot your Esquilo ID or local IP address?  Just log into the Esquilo Nest and click a button to either connect over your local network or connect through the cloud.  The Esquilo Nest will also evolve to add new features such as notifying you if your Esquilo is not accessible, shared cloud storage, application download, and more.Esquilo is programmed with the Squirrel language which is very similar to JavaScript and C++.  If you've ever programmed in either language, then Squirrel is easy to pick up.  We include a large set of support libraries that make it easy to access files, perform math and string operations, and control the hardware peripherals.  Also, if you've ever programmed with the Arduino Wiring language, we've made it easy to migrate by including an emulation of the Arduino API in Squirrel.How many times have you crashed your device with a trivial programming error?  You then have to waste time to locate the error, fix it, recompile, and download your program again.  Well, those days are now gone.  Squirrel runs inside a virtual machine just like JavaScript or Python but with a much smaller footprint more appropriate for an embedded device.  The Squirrel virtual machine isolates your application and makes Esquilo nearly impervious to programming errors.  Esquilo will simply flag the error and allow you to correct it without skipping a beat.Esquilo's built-in web server makes it easy to create connected applications using web technologies.  Esquilo makes the process trivial by allowing the JavaScript in the web application to make direct function calls into the embedded application.  Data is transferred in both directions with JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) so it is easy to troubleshoot.  We call this feature Esquilo Remote Procedure Call or E-RPC for short.But E-RPC doesn't just stop with JavaScript in your web browser, you can also integrate it with standalone applications using a REST-like interface.  Here is an example E-RPC call using curl: You also can call E-RPC with an HTTP POST:Or you can call it from your favorite programming or scripting language such as this Python example: E-RPC makes it easy to integrate embedded functionality into virtually any connected application.The heart of Esquilo is a Freescale Kinetis ARM Cortex-M4F processor running at 120MHz.  This processor is packed full of features including a 1MB flash, 256K SRAM, hardware floating-point, hardware encryption, 16- bit ADC's, a number of serial buses, and the list goes on and on.  The 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi interface is built around a Broadcom chipset.  There are two options for powering your Esquilo, a 2.1mm barrel jack with a 6 to 17V DC supply or with 5V via the micro-USB jack.  There are a large number of hardware features so take a look below for a longer list.120 MHz ARM Cortex-M4F1MB flash, 256KB SRAM, 8KB EEPROM802.11b/g/n Wi-FiArduino UNO R3 shieldsHardware cryptography engineHardware floating point6-17V DC power input (or 5V via USB)Micro-USB (for bootloader and USB CDC console)Micro-SD with FAT32 support (up to 32 GB)46 digital I/Os (5V tolerant inputs)Serial buses: 2 x SPI, 2 x I2C, 5 x UART, 1 x CAN18 PWM outputsQuadrature digital input16 analog inputs with 16-bit resolution (4 differential)Analog output with 12-bit resolutionPrecision voltage referenceAnalog comparatorEsquilo would not have been possible without all of the great open source software available in the community.  It seems only natural for us to give back too.  That's why our hardware design is completely open source.  Want to see the schematics or build a board for yourself?  It's all available on our web site.  Much of our software is also open source and available on GitHub.  Want to create your own cloud portal?  No problem.  Download our secure tunnel daemon and run it on your own server.  Want to add a new Squirrel library?  You can do that too.As big fans of the maker movement, we have created a wide variety of DIY projects with Arduino, Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone, and a slew other development platforms.  A simple development board like Arduino lets you quickly jump in and start creating.  But to add Wi-Fi, you've got to buy an Arduino and Linux mash-up board or add an expensive Wi-Fi shield and spend lots of effort integrating software just to provide basic networking.Esquilo has Arduino-like simplicityOn the other end of the spectrum, Linux-based boards like the Raspberry Pi or BeagleBone let you leverage a vast array of open source networking software but integrating them together still requires a lot of work and know-how. You've got to install a Wi-Fi dongle, load drivers, write configuration scripts, and install software packages just to get a usable Wi-Fi networking stack going.Esquilo has Linux-like networking functionalityThere is also a new crop of IoT development platforms that make it much easier to get a Wi-Fi networking application going but these new platforms share a common flaw in that they require you to use cloud infrastructure.  In essence, they are ""handcuffed"" to the cloud.  Esquilo gives you the freedom to choose to use the cloud or not.  Since everything you need is built-in, Esquilo is perfectly happy running in an isolated network.We think the community needs a development platform that bridges the gap between simple boards like Arduino and complex Linux-based systems to enable developers to create rich, network-enabled applications with ease without the cloud dependencies.  That’s why we created Esquilo.Nothing drives home an idea like a good example.  Let's go through the weather station demonstration in the video in detail to show you how easy it is to develop a connected application with Esquilo.Weather demo in a Safari browserWe are using a SparkFun weather shield that uses two I2C sensors, the MPL3115A2 for pressure, and the HTU21D-F for humidity and temperature.  For the embedded app, we write a getWeather() function to read each parameter from the sensors over the I2C bus and a little code to initialize the sensors and the hardware.Next we write some JavaScript and HTML boilerplate for the web page.  The JavaScript calls the getWeather() function using our E-RPC technology in the embedded app once per second and updates the HTML.  Combine this with a style sheet and you have a 100% code complete connected weather station.Gas MeterThe gas meter demo shows you how to create a smart WiFi gas meter that you can use to graph your natural gas or propane usage as well as monitoring your bill and greenhouse gas emissions.Remote LCDThe LCD demo shows remote control of a Newhaven Serial RGB LCD module using the NetIO mobile control app.Sprinkler ControllerThe sprinkler controller demo shows how to run an autonomous task on your Esquilo that functions independently from the web interface. It uses the Squirrel Timer class to run asynchronous timers in the background to control the sprinkler zones. The web interface is used to both configure the schedule for the zones and to immediately control their operation.  The demo uses a Seeed Studio relay shield to control the sprinkler zones.Esquilo 3DThe Esquilo 3D demo shows a three dimensional Esquilo logo that moves in real time to match the orientation of the Esquilo board. The demo uses a Freescale IMU shield with accelerometer, magnetometer, and gyroscope. The logo is rendered on the browser using WebGL and the three.js JavaScript 3D library.Top and bottom views of the ProtoShellWe also developed a prototyping shell - our name for an Arduino shield with our 40 pin expansion header - to allow you to add your own custom hardware on top of Esquilo.  The middle of the ProtoShell has a 12 x 12 grid for through hole components surrounded by power and ground bus bars.  There is also an area with a variety of footprints for adding SMT components, each with their own through hole pads to jumper to.  There are footprints for SOIC, SOP, SOT363, SOT23, 0603/0402, and 1206/0804.  Also, each pin coming from the Esquilo has a dedicated through hole pad so you can stack more shields or shells on top.If you know someone who might be interested in easily creating Internet-connected things, then please help us spread the word.  The bigger the Kickstarter campaign, the more cool things we can add to Esquilo.Thanks for checking us out!Help us get to $25K, and we will add an MQTT client with an easy-to-use Squirrel interface that also supports MQTT over SSL/TLS.  This will make it super easy to integrate Esquilo into any MQTT network and communicate with other IoT devices. Help us get to $50K, and we will include a MicroSD card with every reward we ship to store programs, data, web content, or whatever using Esquilo's MicroSD slot. Help us get to $75K, and we add an Esquilo Nest cloud drive and integrate it into the Esquilo operating system. You can read and write files stored in the cloud drive from your Squirrel programs, run Squirrel programs in the cloud from the Esquilo IDE, and share files between your Esquilos. Help us get to $100K, and we will include an Esquilo ProtoShell with every reward.  For those rewards that already include them, then you'll get an extra ProtoShell.  Esquilo is a great prototyping tool and having a flexible prototyping area for extra hardware sure comes in handy.The Esquilo project started in June of 2014.  By September, we had hardware prototypes working with a full WiFi stack.  In November, we had the Squirrel virtual machine executing code with a fully functional IDE.  We spent December through February implementing the secure cloud access and Esquilo Nest and entered beta testing in March.  Our first production run is under way and we are set to be able to ship the first round of rewards by June of 2015.Esquilo prototype, revision A0, and revision A1We have a great relationship with our contract manufacturer who is based very near us in Austin, Texas.  We have already made a pilot run of Esquilos on their production line which are currently in the hands of our beta testers.  Our first production for our Kickstarter is already in progress.PCB Panel for ProductionWe are big believers in testing products to assure quality from the design phase all of the way through to production.  We developed a sophisticated test fixture for manufacturing that performs both electrical and functional tests to assure quality and make our manufacturing process as efficient as possible.  We based our test fixture on a custom interface board connected to a Raspberry Pi running open source JTAG and testing software.Production Test FixtureScott Shumate started his hardware hacking career in his early teenage years by ripping apart the family's Tandy 1000 PC to see how it worked.  He went on to study hardware more seriously by earning a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering from the University of Kansas.  Scott was a lead architect at industry bellwether Cisco Systems for 8 years.  He has also shown his entrepreneurial talent by founding successful start-ups including Linux home automation pioneer uControl.  In his spare time, he enjoys contributing to open source with projects such as writing BOSSA, the ARM flash programmer in the Arduino IDE, the ShumaTech digital readouts, and many others.Patrick Jackson has been coding since his dad brought home a Sinclair ZX80 way back in 1980. He holds a BSEE from the University of Texas and has performed architecture and team lead roles for the industry leader Cisco Systems, as well as a handful of startups. He founded a successful consulting firm, where he and his partners provided full-stack hardware, firmware, and software development services for a wide range of companies and products. He spends exactly the right amount of his spare time (and money) hacking together home automation projects.Given our extensive professional experience and the fact that we have a fully working system already in beta test, we are very confident that the technical risks to this project are minimal.  Production risks are low since we have an established relationship with a US-based contract manufacturer that has already built pilot units for the beta test and our production run is already in progress.  Fulfillment risks are minimal since we have handled large volume shipments for previous projects and know how to do this efficiently.The main uncertainty is concerning delivery dates if there turns out to be substantial interest in Esquilo that exceeds our first production run.  We could exhaust available parts inventories for manufacturing a second run but we will mitigate this by staging the delivery of the rewards as availability allows."
T-Bone & the Cherry Hogs|failed|"IS THIS REALLY THE MOST ANTICIPATED SEQUEL SINCE ""ISHTAR""?(Probably not, but it will get you rabbiting)So cast yer mince pies on the Jackanory:After the tremendous success of Arizona Seaside, Fans wanted more.So with an original script and standout characters this sequel will follow in its footsteps, but this time the Turtle Doves are off and we're going well past down and two thirty.Just a few more Squid is required to complete the short film trailer for Festival inclusions, Industry and Studios.We are shooting in unique docu style with state of the art equipment as we follow what happens to Tony T Bone after Arizona Seaside...In the years following the events at the Seaside Motel in Arizona, Tony led a rather uneventful and quiet life until his sidekick and cohort ""Doc"" Powell was brutally murdered in Los Angeles.Being a loyal friend (not to mention he hates losing anything) T Bone decides to get the old gang from the East End of London together to avenge Doc's untimely demise...""LA's not that porky pig really, is it?""But revenge can be costly, and now they are hunting down the most brutal killers who care less where you come from.Not to mention... ""we're no bleedin' spring chickens any more"".In the end just who becomes the prey? ... you've never seen T Bone like this before.These original characters are right out of a Guy Ritchie World, but set in a Tarantino Los Angeles... Imagine more Marbles and Conkers than ""Lock, Stock & 2 Smokin' ... meets ""Pulp Fiction"" with a little Harold Pinter thrown in.And you're not going to Adam & Eve who the Hogs are up against... we introduce a thrilling and original perspective to the protagonists, NEVER been seen in any film before, people will be rabbitin' about this for Donkey's (it really is a cult classic in the making).We are serious, dedicated, original and innovative film makers with a proven track record (no porkies, we're keeping it Ian Beale). Have a butcher's here.Givin' us your bread 'n honey will help us make this bleedin' amazin', fantastic, cracking short film that will eventually become another FULL length feature.You will have our eternal Tom Hanks for whatever you can give, so even if it's just for Flight Lieutenant Biggles and a fenner, or you really want to join us for a King Lear, then Shabba Ranks to you, mutt's nuts.In the East End if you're in Barney Rubble, then you dog and bone 999.Well, this is our ""9999"" for you, and where you can do some Robin Hood.We're not askin' for your dicky dirt, just a Jim Fenner'll do, and for a Macaroni you get a DVD of Arizona Seaside + a RESERVED copy of T Bone.Now, on the other hand if you dip into yer skyrocket and give us a nifty, then you get a real bargain for your dosh... A DVD of Arizona Seaside AND this reserved copy of T Bone will be autographed by the Director and the entire cast (bloody brilliant if you ask me).AND if any generous Juilus Caesar wants to give above and beyond a donation amount, then we'll invite him/her for a nice king lear*.                               So whatever you give us goes straight in the fish tank for the following:    Location, location, location -We have an awesome set with all the necessary 'accoutrements' to live in this dark world. BUT... 3 more days is required to complete (tough but doable).    Set dressing - It has to look authentic so with a budget of a mere 3 bags of sand we can stretch our imaginations (not to mention our arms and scotch eggs) to at least get a Betty Grable and Owen Nares with a Tommy Trinder.    The Cast - Guess how many Actors are in LA... now quarter that amount for 'authentic' Limeys... now half that again for close to that 'right' Actor... now half that and we're closer... You guessed it, we have the most memorable ensemble cast ever assembled for this kick ass project. And they also require the occasional farthing**.    A Crew - Though cameras are high end nowadays, they aren't as lemon tart without an operator. And while ""many hands make light work"" it's always nice to pay them for their hands (and plates o' meat of course).    Which brings us to - Food - Yes, the cast and crew always get peckish so we keep 'em well chuffed with a full Auntie Nellie... grub isn't Meryl Streep you know.    Doling out for studio time and ""original"" Music tracks. Movie's are really really Shepherd's Plaid without memorable kick arse Ding Dongs.    Festival submissions - With such a limited budget, it's essential to select the festivals that can give us the most exposure etc. Submission costs can get pretty Radio Rental.Other Ways to do us a cheesey quaver -If you can’t give any Bugs right now, we understand but you can still lend a hand:We need you to get the dicky bird out and make the biggest box-o-toys about T Bone & the Cherry Hogs.    Be a 'friend' at Tone's Boat Race Captain Hook page    Don't forget to use ALL your facebook and tweets!Well that’s it for now, so go gen up online and translate the 'rhyming slang' and get to know the world of T Bone & the Cherry Hogs.And keep checking the updates section (somewhere up top) cuz you know we're not done yet with this Daily Mail.* Limited to and not exceeding 2 pints, and limited in Caesars (we're not spending this in a bloody Battle Cruiser).And the offer is only available within the environs of the city of Angels, at a very decent publik house.** Cast list to be announced Alligator.UPDATE:We are extremely excited to be working with our good friend Sanjay Pandya who has jumped on board as a Producer for this and other projects at think1. Welcome Sanjay :)More Information on Sanjay can be found on the bio page.What happens next:If you are unaware, kickstarter only releases the funds when we do reach the FULL amount.Sadly, if we fail to reach or exceed the goal of 3k, we'll have to push back the entire production, including post production for studio time etc. not to mention the timing is crucial for festival submissions.And if we want to get the FULL feature made within the next year then this short trailer has to 'do the rounds' at the festivals for the necessary exposure.( A year's delay can be disastrous within the H'wood machine)We really are extremely confident that this is a project that will help to launch our creative team's future, showcasing our other projects we have on the back burner.But we have to be seen to be seen, and prove we are indeed prolific (not just one hit wonders).""T Bone"" and our other original scripts are the result of many many years in the making, Hugh and Pil wearing many hats and paying dues as Actors, Directors, editors and scriptwriters for other people's projects, but now we're finally taking our destinies into our own hands.(Check out the Bio section for more about us)Remember your reaction the first time seeing a Guy Ritchie or Tarantino flick?Well, we know you'll feel the same way about us at think 1 and we know that T bone can be our ticket into that special group of amazing memorable film makers.So, apart from receiving the awesome DVD's and our eternal Tom Hanks, you will also become a part of a cult favorite... the full length Film will certainly be one to remember.And don't forget to join the hundreds of T Bone's facebook fans and help to spread the word."
Random Table Wiki|successful|Random tables are a popular part of roleplaying games whether it is coming up with a random monster during a forest trek, naming an inn, or coming up with quirks for a new NPC the players meet. What's not fun is finding all the tables you want, carrying around a notebook of random tables, updating those tables and manually doing the rolling. Enter Random Table Wiki!With the Random Table Wiki all of those tables get stored in a wiki for easy creating & updating and you can then roll on those tables using any browser! The RandomTableWiki is already up and running! You can see the wiki here. Backers at the You Can't Wait level and higher can start using the wiki right now!Anyone can make rolls on the random tables in the wiki right now! You make your random table requests at this website. Use RandomTableWiki everywhere: On your computer, on your Mac, on your tablet, or on your smartphone. Anywhere you have an internet connection, you'll be able to use RandomTableWiki. Collaborate on Tables: Any table you create in the wiki will be usable by other people and any table someone else creates will be usable by you. My hope is that the wiki will grow to hold a large collection of quality random tables. Easy Table Sharing: With one wiki holding all of the tables, you won't have to hunt down and install other users' tables and you won't have to do anything special to share your tables with others. RandomTableWiki  will be the one place for all your random table gaming needs. Easy Table Creation: Creating a table is as simple as making a list of results. Powerful Table Creation: With the ability for one table's result to call another table (and for that table's result to call another table, and so on and so on), you can make powerful random tables utilizing many, many tables for one result. While the basic prototype is up & running. The RandomTableWiki definitely still needs some polish before it's ready for everyone to start to using. Really though, the Kickstarter is to see how much demand there is for this idea. If the community supports it and is interested, then there are several stretch goals I have in mind. Everyone, backer or not, can start using the random tables that exist in the wiki right now. Look at the wiki to see what tables are available and roll all you want on the request website. Everyone who pledges at the I Can't Wait level or higher, will gain access to the RandomTableWiki right now (well, give me a day or so to add you in). You'll get access to the Google group to discuss things and edit permission to the wiki so you can start creating and modifying tables. Backers who support at the higher levels will help the RandomTableWiki achieve the stretch goals. The more the project funds, the more features I can add! The first stretch goal is below:$1000 - Member Area, Buttons & BookmarksWhile typing in your request works, it's not the quickest and easiest way to get a random table result. If this stretch goal is acheived, we'll add a members area to the Random Table Wiki. In the member's area, you'll be able to create buttons for your favorite tables and then just click the button to make those rolls without having to type anything in. You'll also be able to bookmark a button so that you can easily do a roll that way. Proof of concept is already complete as shown in the video. It just needs to be cleaned up, hopefully with stretch goals, and some more functions added to it. The author has developed multiple, data-driven websites as programmer for Paladin Programming and has delivered on a previous Kickstarter as the author of DM's Familiar.

Natural face, feet, and body scrubs|successful|I was recently laid off from my job after 10 years and am a stay at home mother of a beautiful 1 year old girl. I have been job searching but with places around my area laying off people it has been hard. I have a passion for DIY crafts and I would love to start up a business making body scrubs for people in my area and possibly even start an etsy store. My start up costs will be about $120. This will cover the air proof jars, the essential oils I will need, and the remainder of the ingredients for each different scrub I plan to make. This will in turn help me feel like I am being productive and still allow me to spend precious time with my little girl. I don't seen any risks or challenges arising in my project, I have the recipes I want to complete, the only challenge is raising the money to purchase the products.
LDS Home Teaching App (Visiting Teaching Too)|failed|"I am a father a blended family that consists of 7 boys and 1 girl. I have always struggled with my home teaching. Lots of excuses, lots of list changes, lots of missed calls. So, I decided to do something about it. As a graphic designer with 18 years experience I knew enough to get started and I am now working with a mobile app development company to develop an approximate cost for this app. IF WE CAN FULLY FUND THIS APP, IT WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR BOTH ANDROID AND IPHONE. I got tired of feeling bad each month when the reminders to get your home teaching done came 'round. If this app can help/motivate even a few people then I have done something good. Faith without works is dead. And I this is my attempt to stop hiding behind excuses and start a movement within elder's quorums around the globe. No More Excuses!I received such a great response from the sisters as well asking ""Where's our app?"" that I have already started working on it and plan to launch them both at the same time. But for that to happen we will need to blow my initial target out of the water. Some of the features for the visiting teaching app will include:Canning Video and printed instructionFamily Home Evening Ideas and ResourcesQuick Links to your favorite Meetup and Facebook GroupsEmergency Prep Resources and planning guidesand anything else we can think of between now and then!So the visiting teaching app will  not just a re-branded version of the the home teaching app. I know you are as excited about this as I am so, choose a level you are comfortable with and help me change the way home teaching AND visiting teaching are done FOREVER!Disclaimer: This app is not directly affiliated with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, nor endorsed by the same. I am a member of the Church but that is as close as any tie gets. I love the Lord and I am just trying to do what I can to bring all unto Christ.I have spent over a year mapping out all the features, the logistics behind them and how they can be integrated with existing data and technology on the web, but as with all things...change happens. The features of this app will only be modified if there is absolutely no alternative. The goal is to make the best home teaching and visiting teaching aid available for mobile devices. If we exceed our goal, every effort will be made to improve upon the base features.Apps take time and as you know, debugging is crucial. How many apps have you loaded into your phone with excitement only to be let down because it doesn't work. On my word, I will do everything within my power to ensure that this app is as bug free as possible. But as you know, there are many different devices on the market and your understanding is appreciated as the app is launched. Our launch window is currently 2 months from funding. This may be adjusted to ensure a quality app is produced but all perks will be given regardless of timeline for app development.."
Mother, I am going|successful|MOTHER, I AM GOINGCombining performance-art, documentary and visually constructed pieces, thefilm will travel a crisscrossing path through the scarred landscape of EasternEurope, and the changing landscape of the human mind.At the age of 9, I lost my mother to Leukaemia. My dadsaved me and my 3 siblings, yet my memories of childhood, especially of mymother, are very few. From the ages of 9-15, I watched and re-watched our homemovies of her. Slowly, my mother became the image of a mother, a depiction offemininity in all its grace and beauty. Last winter I learned that there was astock of film of my mother which I hadn’t seen – 8mm footage of her as a child.In the deep colour and flickering movement of these films, for just a fewshimmering seconds, I finally saw my mom.Almost everyone has lost someone they loved deeply. It is often very difficult to understand and express our feelings about such a painful experience. We believe that this film is really important, not just for us, but for anyone who understands loss. This film will explore the subject in an alternative way to what we are used to seeing on television and in Hollywood films. We are going to use our bodies, experimental sound, poetry and observational footage to present an unconventional look at childhood memory, adult identity and our understandings of femininity. ABOUT USI have beenwith my partner Caitlin for seven years now, and we have been working togetheras artists for over 4 years. ‘Mother, I am going’ marks a point at which ourvideo-performance work meets our documentary filmmaking. It is our mostimportant work to date, and this vision we have, of making a cross-genre film, is something that we have been excited about for a long time.“Thevideo installation ‘Clinging’ which they presented in June 2011 was wellconceived and very powerful. It was made with a very slender budget, which inno way diminished its effect as a strong and provocative piece of work.” Stuart Cameron, Director of CrescentArtsOur collaborative partnership began at the ArtsUniversity at Bournemouth, where we graduated in 2012 with first class honorsin BA Photography. We have exhibited in galleries nationally andinternationally. Our 44 minute graduation film, In Search of SilentLandscapes, premiered at the 26th Leeds International Film Festival inNovember 2012, becoming a 'festival favorite', with two sell-out screenings. “A very interesting film ... thestart on black with voice over, the brilliant cinematography, the pace - a vision of an extraordinarily driven woman.”  Peter Symes, BBC ProducerIn 2012,Caitlin was identified as an emerging talent by the film producer, Colin Pons (‘TheAcid House’, ‘Hush’). After a nationalcall, Caitlin was selected to take part in ‘FilmWorks’,a Creative England professional development scheme for up and coming filmdirectors and producers. During the three month intensive programme, Caitlinreceived invaluable one-to-one mentoring from industry professionals, anddeveloped the skills and vision needed to bring to life an ambitious projectlike ‘Mother, I am going’.FilmWorks final networking event at Watershed, BristolThe support of FilmWorks, the success of ‘In Search ofSilent Landscapes’, and my revelations in seeing my mom as a child, has givenus the courage and conviction that now is the right time to embark on this mostintimate work. WHERE ARE WENOW?In the last two months we were invited to show our workin two exhibitions in Berlin. We performed live together for the first time(very nerve-wracking), allowing us to gather some beautiful footage to use in ‘Mother, I am going’. Our performance at AGORA, BerlinWe are working with two magical poems by theBengali writer, Rabindranth Tagore, and have recorded some initial voice-overwith the celebrated Canadian artist Margaret Dragu. We aim tocomplete the film in Spring 2014. The finished work will be exhibited as amulti-screen gallery installation, and will also be edited as a single-channelfestival film. We plan tosubmit the film to various film and art festivals. Encounters Short FilmFestival in Bristol are excited about this type of cross-genre film, andthrough FilmWorks, we have made a great connection with the festival programmerwho is really positive about the project, and the possibility of premiering thefilm at Encounters 2014. We are also constantly networking and seeking outspaces, such as AGORAin Berlin and SITE Gallery in Sheffield, to show the multi-screen installationnationally and internationally. We will utilise our growing network of contacts to make sure that the finished work can be seen by as many people as possible… that’swhat it is all about after all!THE JOURNEY BEGINS...We wouldlove you to join us on this journey… in fact, we need you to join us on thisjourney. This Kickstarter Campaign is our first venture into crowd funding, andwe feel that it is the best chance we have to raise the funds needed to producethis film in the most artistically uncompromising way possible. Finding andtraveling to the locations that are essential to the work, both visually andconceptually will take time and money. In an abandoned village in Bulgaria weplan to shoot a performance using rubble and personal items, toys and photographs,gathered from the derelict houses of former inhabitants. We will seek out thevast and other-worldly landscapes of Eastern Europe as a metaphor for thelandscape of memory, and a backdrop for the film’s exploration of loss. We alsoplan to work with a musician to create a unique, experimental musical score forthe film.From nowuntil the completion of the project in spring 2014, we will completely devoteour time and passion to our film, living in the converted bus which is our homeand studio, and putting every penny into production and post-production. Final book layout for 'In Search of Silent Landscapes'It ishard to describe what this film means to us, and how grateful we are for everysingle donation. Each pledge is a voice behind us; someone else who believes inthe importance of this work, and our ability to make it fantastic. Please joinus on this exciting journey! Thank you.THANK YOU REWARDSWe think we have come up with some pretty special ways to say thank you, and to bring you along on the journey with us. We are so happy you believe in us, get ready to receive one sweet cyber kiss!We literally can't wait to get our bodies into action and create an on-the-spot, unique, 10 second performance video to e-mail over to you within 24 hours of your pledge. Please don't forget to send us your e-mail address or you will have to wait until August for any kisses, hugs or 10 second performances :-(Here is a little example of what to look forward to...The original moon drawings come from an on-going work called MANY MOONS.  Our Many Moon project is an integral part of our research for the multi-screen installation and is a focused attempt at recognising the sacred in the everyday, of documenting the now. The project consists of a series of drawings of the moon with accurate co-ordinates and collection number written on the paper. Each drawing accompanies a 10-30 second video clip, which is presented on our website.For an experimental project like ‘Mother, I am going’, storyboards are an important part of the idea development, and they also work as a means of communication between us…director to cinematographer. These storyboard images are more stylistic and detailed drawings inspired by our earlier rough storyboard sketches. Each drawing shows our vision for a scene in ‘Mother, I am going’. These are just a few of the rewards, if you have any questions, or would like to know more about the rewards, we would love to hear from you. Enjoy!STAY UPDATEDIf you like what you see here on Kickstarter and on our website, please tell your friends about this project. Lets join our networks and spread the word. Many thanks!Join our mailing list, then follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and of course, here, for more updates!HOW KICKSTARTER WORKSWhen you donate to Mother, I am going via Kickstarter, we ONLY get the donation IF the campaign reaches its £3,000 goal. If the campaign does not reach its goal, then we receive £0, and you donate £0! Whatever happens, you will still get the unique 10 second performance video ;-)☑ Your payment is as easy as buying a DVD from Amazon.com. (Here is a video on how to pledge.)☑ Your pledge amount is NOT displayed publicly.☑ You can change your pledge at any time. (Here's a video on how to modify your pledge.)☑ You can pledge from anywhere in the world!In Britain, much traditional art remains restrictive and inward looking, as cinema becomes increasingly focused on big budget entertainment. We have a strong wish to engage new audiences in art and offer an alternative perspective on filmmaking. It can often be a challenge for cross-genre films like ours to be seen by a wider audience outside of the art gallery. By producing a film that has high production values and beautiful, high quality sound, music and post-production, we will have the best chance of getting the film seen at festivals all over the world, and also getting the film streamed online. Having produced and exhibited several multi-screen video installations, and made a 44 minute documentary film over the course of two years, we understand that the creative process is not always easy. We know that there will be days when we question the core of what it is we are doing, but we also understand deeply that these low points are necessary in creating a really good, sincere film. The story at the heart of ‘Mother, I am going’ could not be more important to us, which means that the energy and courage needed to overcome any struggle, exists in abundance. Have no fear… this project could not mean more to us!
Fritz: A Robotic Puppet|successful|"Did you miss the Fritz Kickstarter? You can buy Fritz at www.xyzbot.com/store.phpFritz is a robotic head, with moving eyes and jaw, but also (in the advanced version available) eyelids, eyebrows, lips and moving neck.  Fritz is great fun, but also a great educational tool.  Update: Stretch goal added. $42K and we will... 1) Include a sonar sensor with every $70 and higher reward.  And we will include software to allow Fritz to run in standalone mode, no PC.  So he will react when the sonar sensor triggers. For halloween, you could set up Fritz to start talking when people walk in front of him.2) Tweet reader - We will add software to have Fritz read your Tweets to you as they come in.  You just connect to Twitter using the Fritz app, and he'll read it to you.Fritz says thanks for helping him to reach the $35K stretch goal in this video.  This is a white acrylic Fritz, and really needs the sun, so thanks a lot for helping us hit $35K. This video was made with an actual Fritz, using the Fritz app.Here is an MDF Fritz video a week ago, asking for help on the stretch goal.With our $35K funding we have added ""behaviors"" for Fritz, taking input from things like a webcam or sensors and react to them.  First behavior: He will be able to detect a face using your existing webcam and then ""wake up"" and greet you with ""Good morning"".  Or to tell you the local temperature, or the temperature in Rome or wherever you'd rather be. So, the app will include ability to get input from sensors, and to read headline from Yahoo news and say it to you.  Over time, we will add other scripted behaviors that you can download.Who can use Fritz?For kids, Fritz is a great project to start with robotics and animatronics.  And once he is built, they can continue to learn and have fun by customizing him, adding features, making a movie starring Fritz, etc.  Fritz can even be a way to study the psychology of human expression and emotion.For those that just want to have fun with a robot head, Fritz is ready for duty.  You can use Fritz to build a display for Halloween.  Fritz can talk to Trick-or-treaters, or scare them into dropping those pillowcases and collect the loot for yourself.For more experienced users, Fritz is a good way to break into human emotion mimicry robotics.  The computer software and the Arduino firmware will be open source and can be modified.Basic and Advanced ModelsFritz is offered in two versions:  Basic and Advanced.  Basic Fritz has moveable eyes, and jaw.  The Basic model is less expensive and easier to build.  Advanced Fritz has greater range of expression, adding eyelids, eyebrows, lips and moveable neck.I'm not a robotics expert.  Will I be able to build and use Fritz?Fritz was designed to be easy to assemble.  No robotics experience required.  Fritz is recommended for ages 12 and above. Tools needed are a small Phillips head screwdriver, needle-nose pliers, and glue.  We recommend hot glue or Gorilla Glue.  Budget about 2 hours to build Basic Fritz and 3 hours for Advanced Fritz.Using Fritz is easy once he is assembled.  The control application helps you to get him set up, then you just start having fun, clicking on features and playing around.  You can connect a joystick and control him that way rather than using the app and a mouse and keyboard.  The open source software makes it easy to update and modify if you want to, but no Arduino, or electronics, or programming experience is needed.What about the control app?  XYZbot has created a Windows application that allows you to control Fritz with your mouse, or keystrokes, or even a joystick or game controller.  The app has a picture of Fritz's face.  When you move your mouse over his face, green control dots will appear.  For example, click on an eye and you will see red arrows appear (see photo above) that show which direction the eye can be moved. You just click and drag to move that part.  Or you can click on a pre-generated ""expression"" like Happy, Sad, Disappointed, etc. The Fritz face in the app will show that expression and robot Fritz will move his features at the same time. You can record a sequence of actions and play them back.  WIth his Text to Speech feature, you can type in text and Fritz will ""speak"", moving his jaw and lips in sync.You can also use a joystick for a ""live"" feel.  If you want to use Fritz as a puppet or ventriloquist dummy, this is probably the best option since you can can get very complex behavior very quickly.More about Behaviors and RoboRealmWhat if Fritz could ""see"" you sit at your desk in the morning and say hello and tell you the temperature outside, or a news headline, or insult you if you like to start the day that way.  Our stretch goal for $35,000 will make this possible.  We will include 2 behaviors called ""Webcam Detect and Greet"", and ""Tell me temperature"".  Over time we will add more behaviors which you can download, like apps for you smart phone.This is done using the program RoboRealm which will be bundled with Fritz kits IF WE HIT $35K.  RoboRealm will give YOU the ability to script your own behaviors like have Fritz read headlines from your favorite news feed, or stock quotes.  You will be able to write scripts yourself, or download from our site and have them just run using the Fritz app without ever opening RoboRealm or any other program.  For those that are technologically adventurous, RoboRealm is a powerful program for easily and quickly bringing machine vision to your robotics project.  RoboRealm is $49.95 at normal price, but if you back Fritz at $70 and above, you get a copy for no additional cost to you. IF WE HIT $35K, so please forward and tweet this project page link and help us get the word out.How does this compare to other robot products?There are a few products similar to Fritz on the market now.  We are convinced that Fritz gives the most function for the price.  The biggest value that Fritz brings is the control software, which has a picture of Fritz's face that moves with Fritz's actual robotic parts.  Other control software use a slider bar that is labeled ""jaw"" or ""left eye"" which is less intuitive than simply dragging a part on a simulated face.  The table below shows how we compare to other products along with price.Read some press about Fritz Click below to see articles published about FritzFritz goes snazzy - Acrylic in colors now offeredWe have had many requests for an acrylic (plastic) with color option, so we have added rewards for acrylic Fritz kits.  A quick sample of what acrylic parts look like below.  Note that all parts will be acrylic in the kit, not just the faceplate.  We offer Fritz in blue, white, red, green,  and clear acrylic.  Stay tuned for more colors as we confirm availability.  You will specify color at the end of the project by our survey. Here are some sample acrylic units built up.Tour de Fritz - Video of Fritz's DesignBelow is a video that shows the inner workings of Fritz.  See how the eyes and eyelids work.  It's like an anatomy lesson but without the blood and other messy stuff.Open SourceWe made Fritz to be an affordable and accessible human feature mimicking robot project, not just a cool toy.  Fritz will be an open source project.  If we are funded, we will publish all the design files, both hardware and software, so you can build one yourself if you have access to a laser cutter and/or a 3D printer, and have some computer savvy.  In the long term, we want Fritz to evolve and become more sophisticated, not just through the efforts of XYZbot, but from hobbyists and professionals all over the world.  We all see humanoid robots in the movies,  walking around and interacting with humans, but a lot of work has to be done to move the technology to that level.  Fritz is a great way to facilitate this.  Even if you decide to not pledge for a Fritz robot, you can consider backing the project to help develop this technology.What are funds used for?Fritz has custom parts that have to be manufactured specifically for this product.  We have to have tools made to manufacture these parts.  A big piece of our project goal is taken up by these tooling and setup fees.  We also have to buy parts in bulk to get the lowest cost.  And finally, don't forget that Kickstarter and Amazon Payments take about 10% of the funds raised.  No complaints from us.  We love Kickstarter, but not every backer realizes that.No Worries of Robot World Domination T-shirtDo you like the idea of Fritz but you are afraid of him rebelling and dominating the world?  Then get this T shirt to fend off such worries.  You can get behind robotics in technical education, get a great t shirt and sleep soundly at night.BookmarkFor those that like the idea of an open source robot head project, but don't want to actually buy one, you can help out by backing us at lower levels.  Back at $15 level and get a laser cut FritzMark; a bookmark with a distinctive Fritz head to stick out of your book and keep an eye on you.  The bookmark is laser cut and engraved from recycled card stock.  Below are pictures of the bookmark with the message ""Fritz Lives"", but we're open to suggestions on what the final bookmark should say.Evolution of Fritz, the prototypesWe started working on Fritz in summer of 2012.  Over 6 months, and 20 major revisions later, we are ready to bring to market. Here is a photo showing the mechanical design evolution of Fritz from Neanderthal to RoboHead Sapien.More info?  The video tells the story in brief. If you'd like to see more photos and information, visit our web page at www.xyzbot.comKickstarter is a great platform for promoting and funding projects.  But by now we have all seen some projects that just were not ready to be put on Kickstarter.  When projects fail to deliver, we think it is most often because the project creator was not ready to make the project in bulk.  He or she may have made one or two in their workspace, or garage or even kitchen.  But then when their idea is a hit, they find that making hundreds or even thousands of their terrific idea is beyond their abilities.The risks then for any project are:   Design is too immature.  It is still in prototyping stage        AND / OR   Design works great, but cannot be manufactured in bulkWhat have we done to control these risks?Maturity of design:  XYZbot has spent over 6 months developing Fritz and we are ready to manufacture.  Fritz has evolved over time through more than 20 versions, each time improving features and fixing design problems.  During development we have constructed Fritz in his various manifestations over 30 times, so we have worked out the design and changed things that made assembly difficult.  We have donated some Fritz kits to local schools and had them construct and operate Fritz, and we learned lessons from that and fixed problems there too.  Bulk manufacturing: Can Fritz be made by the hundreds or thousands (or gulp, millions?): XYZbot has worked with manufacturing facilities early on to be sure that all of his parts can be manufactured reliably and in quantity.  XYZbot is staffed by engineers with years of experience in designing projects that can be manufactured, rather than just built one at a time in the garage. (We do have a garage though, by the way).  In addition, XYZbot's engineer Kerwin Lumpkins has created and delivered a successful Kickstarter project, The Desktop Ballista.  He made over 600 units, and delivered them across the globe on schedule.http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/694850905/the-desktop-ballista-shoot-toothpicks-into-the-anc?ref=liveSo what are the risks for Fritz?  We can manufacture up to 3000 Fritzes (is that how you spell plural Fritz?) without difficulty in the time frame that we advertise.  We do that by making them all locally (in Denver area).  If we get more than that number of orders, it will take longer to deliver.  We have planned for this contingency by getting quotes from multiple manufacturers, allowing us to increase production numbers if necessary. We can handle up to 10,000 Fritz orders in this way.   We think it is unlikely, but if we do get more orders than that, it will simply take more time to deliver.  The first 3K would ship on schedule, and additional units would take another month for each 10K units."
Casper & The Bad Spirits LP Funding|successful|“One of the many reasons their performances rock so hard is because they express the emotions of what all listeners have felt at one time or another – of heartbreak, of sadness, and of being stronger because of it”  — Meghan E. Fox, LASF Magazine We Are Casper & The Bad Spirits. We play a unique form of original music that that speaks to everyone. In starting this kickstart project it  is our hope to get into the Studio to capture the energy & spirit of our Live performances. To share with you and many more all the noises that have been swimming in our lives these last few years. With a treasure trove of new material this project promises to be one that will endure. With the established funds to complete our new LP , we hope to tour cities in the USA and Europe , bringing our music to as many people as we can. We are musicians, we live to play, it is our reason for being. Music is a hard field to finance, the multiple people involved with a project from creation to production to distribution , it takes capital to fund. We thank everyone for their consideration and Contributions both large and small. As we have a loyal following, a large network of accomplished professionals and a broad appeal to fan bases, we are confident that with the help of this campaign we can push through and complete our goal of finishing this LP, expanding our fan base and adding to the ever growing group of people we consider our friends. Thanks to everyone for your time , consideration, and donations to our passion for music.

Campbell Glassworks Co.|failed|Campbell Glassworks Co.That's the name of what I'm trying to accomplish with this kickstarter project. Honestly, you could put whatever you wanted to at the end of Campbell and that'd be fair enough for me but it wouldn't do well to describe the legacy that my name has carried on for well over sixty years. My Grandfather, David R. Campbell, is a master glassblower who has taught professionally in New Mexico and held his own business, Campbell Glass. He is a scientific glassblower who has been retired for some time now. My father, Michael Campbell, was a master glassblower as well, took to learning his dad's craft and expanding it into an artistic light as well - creating beautiful works with torch and lathe. I am not a professional. To be honest I'm not even really an amateur. What I know from glassblowing I only know from watching them as they worked, sweating under the heat and dodging the inevitable pieces of broken glass usually coupled with some mild/crude language. I don't have the chance to learn from my father as he did with my grandfather. At the end of July this year, he passed away. It's hard enough typing this out - which is why I don't have a video montage to show everything I'm trying to do. Instead, I'm writing it to you because this is without a doubt the riskiest and hardest endeavor I've ever thought to take on by myself. I can't do it by myself, and that is why I'm here asking you for the help to continue my family's legacy and walk the path towards becoming a third generation master glassblower.Here's the honest truth of it: I don't have any equipment whatsoever - that's what this project is meant to help with. Glassblowing isn't something that you can go 0-60 mph on in three seconds either. Even with the equipment, I still have to learn what I'm doing. Luckily there are people I know who can support and teach me as long as I bring the tools necessary - so I can begin to learn and develop as a glassblower. The biggest challenge is finding a space that is capable of housing all this stuff - but that's been taken care of already. My grandfather has a small shed which was once a fully working, thriving glass studio where he and my father worked together on many projects. With enough TLC, that can be brought back to life again. I must stress that while I do have these rewards listed - they will have to be relearned and recreated before I can feel right sending them out to you - they are handmade, from fond memories of watching my dad blow glass. It is a matter that hits home very hard and dear to me, please understand that.I am hoping that with your support I will be able to do what I was born to do, and have a chance at continuing my father and grandfather's legacy as glassblowers. I sincerely believe that if there are any obstacles to be had in this endeavor, they are beyond worth overcoming.
Zen-Tek Aquaponics- runs on air|failed|Aboutthis project Doyou live in a big city, got a small back yard too, ever think about where allthat lead went from lead-petrol cars?Idid, it went into the soil! Yourkids eating their vegies? Havingan aquaponic system allows them to grow herbs, veggies and fish too just mightdo the trick, they can watch the fish grow and harvest healthy foodFindingit hard to bend over these days but still have the green thumb, easy access forpruning, harvesting what you need every day? Wellthe Zen-Tek aquaponic system has answers for all of these questions Ihave spent many years now constructing Aquaculture and Aquaponic systems as ahobby and professionally. Last year I came up with a system that can be puttogether in modules (think leggo) allowing you to build it to your needs and the water is moved around by AIR!Youcan go down the solar route (designed just for this purpose) or go the cheaper traditional 240 mains power way. Thesystem I use is quite different than conventional water pump technologycurrently used, the duty life of my 3D printed air pumps is decades, not years My project has 3 outcomes 1) Production of an eBook, clearly describing the A-Z of planning and building an Aquaponic system including a list of components you can purchase from Zen-Tek to assist2) The manufacture of a modular Aquaponic system capable of being flat-packed and delivered Australia-wide (international licensing options available)The design allows you to grow the system to your space and food needs using a combination of Solar and 240v power 3) A Zen-Tek website that has all the componentry available for purchase including back-up assistance and trouble shootingI built a 3D printer to make some componentry, I want to conduct more R&D to squeeze as much performance as I can over the next 6 months to try and outdo what I have already achieved so there’s some unknowns it that regard.Ultimately, I would like to flat-pack modules, to that end, I’m constructing my own CNC router so I can nest components and turn out high quality modules.Due to this, there may be some hold-ups along the way, I feel confident that a 6 month window should cover it

Burning Manc Festival|successful|PLEASE NOTE: New rewards added!As the Burning Manc Festival was forced to relocate to Sound Control and be taken on by NOIZ Promotions, we have been left in a position that means we are unable to continue with the event unless we sell tickets via an 'all-or-nothing' crowdfunding campaign, which will end on Friday the 25th of November at 11pm, this allows time for the site to process the pledges and release the funds (if target met). We have set a minimum of £1,800, which will allow us to go ahead with a scaled-down event featuring most of the advertised bill, but for us to be able to continue with our headliners, Melechesh, we need more. To help us reach this target, we have offered rewards that allow entry to other future NOIZ events, and also some bands have offered to reduce/waiver their fees to to help make this happen.This is all being run on a not-for-profit basis, we intend to reach the target that allows us to run the show with the full bill solely in order to continue with this date. If you pledge and the final lineup (at the end of the campaign) isn't one you want to have purchased a ticket for, you will be refunded, no questions asked, or you can swap it for entry to any two NOIZ events in 2017. As NOIZ, we have successfully pulled off several replacement shows, including co-hosting a last minute all-dayer in the aftermath of the Temples Festival cancellation this year. We are confident that this lineup has enough weight to merit the ticket price, though we understand this format is largely untested and rather controversial. However, as stated, our sole intention is to put the bands on a stage, and if we go past covering costs then we will use any profit towards putting on a free extreme metal show in Manchester.Please check all our rewards and support if you want to see the show go ahead! Feel free to ask questions or offer suggestions!https://www.facebook.com/noizpromoRisks: If we should not hit the minimum target, we can not proceed with BMF 2016*. If we do not reach double the minimum, we will be unable to proceed with the FULL SHOW (ie, without Melechesh).Challenges:We're running low on time with a month to go and potentially won't know for a fortnight if we're going to make it.
Airlock bike helmet|failed|"sThe Airlock Bicycle Helmet System.You can control how much air enters the helmet by opening or closing the vents. This is very useful in bad weather, or when an aerodynamic helmet is the requirement.Poly-carbonate helmet你需要支援 HTML5 的瀏覽器才能查看此內容。播放打開聲音重新播放帶聲音播放00:0000:00Short video shows how vents operate Helmet ColorsFive different colorsHelmets will be available in five different colors. Neutral, white, black, red, and blue. All helmets can be made of carbon fiber. However, only the neutral must be in carbon fiber, which shows the natural color of the carbon fabric. The other four can come in carbon fiber or in poly-carbonate or ABS plastic. In the case of carbon fiber helmets they will be painted in the designated colors unless you desire the natural look of the fabric, which allows the carbon fiber fabric to show through, which by the way, is a very popular look when using carbon fiber. On top of everything else, you must admit that this is one of the best looking helmets ever. Check out the cool sleek lines that make the helmet look like it's in motion even when standing still.Pictured above, carbon fiber helmet painted red and poly-styrine linerpoly-styrene linerpoly-styrene linerCarbon fiber helmet. rear view of helmet showing exhaust ventsAir entering and exiting the helmetCarbon fiber helmet, front ventsCarbon fiber helmet side vent openCarbon fiber helmet side vent closedCarbon fiber helmet unpaintedA word about carbon fiberF-35 $400.000 HELMET. The F-35 fighter jet helmet is made of carbon fiber at a cost of $400,000. The properties of carbon fibers, such as high stiffness, high tensile strength, low weight, high chemical resistance, high-temperature tolerance and low thermal expansion, make them very popular in aerospace, civil engineering, military, and motorsports, along with other competition sports. However, they are relatively expensive when compared with similar fibers such as, fibers glass, or plastic fibers. Carbon fibers are usually combined with other materials to form a composite. When combined with a plastic resin and wound or molded it forms carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (often referred to as carbon fiber) which has a very high strength-to-weight ratio and is extremely rigid.Have You ever awoken in the morning to see this?You have to get to work, and the bike ride to work, or the train station is going to be a drag, but you know you have to go anyway. You think to yourself that the helmet that is supposed to protect you, is going to catch every single snowflake by the cold air that is being forced into your helmet. Well, when you have to get to work, is there an alternative? You can't help, but wonder ""is there another way?"" The sight of all that snow might make you want to call in sick, or perhaps even quit your job, but you know you can't do either one of these. However, with all the vents closed on the Airlock helmet and the ear cups in place you feel that you can brave that snowstorm with greater ease, and a warmer and safer ride.Biking in the winter could be such a drag, but some people do it no matter what. You don’t know how cold it gets until you ride with one of the conventional helmets with all open vents. Yes think about it, these helmet are designed keep you cool on hot days. However, this works against you on cold days, and there is nothing they can do about it. Even wearing a cap under the helmet does not keep the cold air that is being forced onto your head. And if it’s wet snow or freezing rain, well you get the idea.The Airlock is intended to be a whole system in helmet design. First, is the helmet itself, this is the core and the basis of the helmet system. Secondly, you have the ear-cups, they are intended to provide protection from cold air to your ears, but they are also intended to make the helmet more aerodynamic when you are riding for competition. The fairing cone is purely a racing device. It is intended to attach onto the back of the helmet for time trial races. The face shield is a provision for all bicycle riders. It protects you from wind and object hurtling towards your face and eyes. It will repel bugs and other objects that might enter your eyes, but it also adds to making the helmet more aerodynamic. A noteAbout the attachments, Originally plans were made for the attachments. Drawings were worked up, but finances put a Holt to proceeding any further, which is part of why we are on kickstarter. For the helmet, the plan is to produce it first, and then work on prototyping the attachments and after, go to production. Once the attachments have been manufactured they can be purchased to fit onto the helmet.ComponentsThere have been many innovations in bicycling in the last twenty years. There is thermal clothing, thermal gloves, and shoes lined with gortex, even face masks for those cold wet days. The bicycle itself has gone through tremendous changes, like carbon fiber frames, clip-on pedals, index shifting, to name a few. Even the helmets themselves have changed for the better, they are lighter, with polystyrene liners that help prevent head trauma. But there is one thing that so far has lagged behind. What do you do when the weather is not sunny and warm? Well! Nothing really, just bear it.T-ShirtsT-Shirt Sizes are, Small, Medium, Large, and Extra Large. Due to computer monitor screen colors schemes, colors will not be exact as they appear on your screen.The embroidered patch will appear as above at three inches wide, and again, colors will vary from what is on your screen.With your help we can bring this fantastic, most useful, and needed bicycle helmet from prototype to production, so please help make this product a reality. Every pledge from five dollars and up will receive the embroidered Aerospeed cycles patch in full color. Please give what you can and become part of our team. With your pledge of twenty-five dollars, you will receive the aerospeed T-shirt in your favorite color. Note! Only contributors pledging for this campaign will receive T-shirts with printing both on the front and back of the shirts. All others will only have printing on the front of the shirts.With your pledge of one hundred and fifty dollars, we will send you the airlock bicycle helmet made of polycarbonate, or ABS material. With your three hundred and fifty dollar pledge, you will get the Airlock bicycle helmet that is made of carbon fiber. The proceeds of this campaign will go to producing the Airlock helmet, packaging, and marketing the helmet through bicycle magazines, bicycle trade shows, and the internet, and of course shipping the final product out to you the consumer. Thank you.link to blog zone is not available yet  The roadThe road in bicycling is just as important as the bicycle itself. Without it, it would not be easy to ride. Thank god it's there, but we must learn to know, and respect it. You see, the road is not as benign as it may seem. You don't know how much you need a helmet until you fall and hit your head for the first time. What happens is, if you go over the handlebars usually your shoulder hits first, this absorbs most of the initial impact, but what happens next is that the impact on your shoulder causes your head to bounce and then slide on the pavement. In a minor impact, you can lose a patch of skin and hair. You also lose skin on your shoulder and anywhere else your body makes contact with the road. Many times an ugly permanent scar remains, and a headache that may last for weeks. When you wear a helmet, the helmet takes the road burn, and at times may even crack. However, better a cracked helmet than a cracked skull. The severity of your injuries is dependent on how fast you are going. You see, if you are going 15 or 20 mile per hour, this is how fast you are thrown onto the ground, 15 or 20 miles per hour. Not nice. This means that we get to know the road in ways that we never knew, or imagined before, and probably will never forget.This picture is a good example why the airlock is so important. First, see how high that helmet sits on the head, in order to accommodate the hood below it. The trouble here is that the rider is trying to protect him, or herself from the cold and the rain, at the cost of injury if there is an accident. That helmet is useless while it's positioned so high, as you can see.How not to wear a helmetSecondly, the helmet is so high on the head that a strap cannot be used, which means that the helmet will be off before the rider hits the ground. The airlock bicycle helmet solved both of these problems.Helmets will be sent for certification testing to agencies like ANSI,  and the Snell Foundation. We have contact with various manufacturer that have provided time tables for production, and estimates. If everything goes as planed with these companies, we should be able to meet our shipping deadlines. As with anything that involves outside manufacturer, things could go wrong, this is beyond our control. However, we have made provisions for backup companies in case there are problems"

Außerdem kombiniere ich zu dem Boutis zwei andere Techniken: die Perlen-und Paillettenstickerei aus Lunéville (in der Haute Couture benutzt) und die Goldstickerei. Ich herstelle auch jede Art von Lampenschirm nach Kundenwunsch, was mir am meistens Spaß macht.Für die Herstellung und auch damit ich mehr Möglichkeiten an Zusammenstellung anbieten kann, brauche ich einiges an Material, manche davon ist auch etwa kostspielig (besonders für die Goldstickerei, und für die Perlen-und Paillettenstickerei). Darüber hinaus verwende ich Material die eine gute Qualität haben müssen, denn es mir ein Anliegen ist, dass meine Objekte mit der bestmöglichen Qualität angefertigt sind. Ich möchte keine Massenproduktion machen, sondern Unikat die dauerhaft sein sollten. Da aber Foto sind besser als eine lange Beschreibung, zeige ich euch hier Teil meiner Arbeit und hoffe ich kann euch für den Boutis und mein Projekt begeistern. Boutis (Detail aus dem Lampenschirm ""Plume"") Lampenschirm ""Plume"" Lampenschirm ""Plume"" Lampe ""arabesque"" Nadelkissen Rosace Nadelkissen ""Rosace"" (Détail) Venusmuscheletui ""Papyrus"" Venusmuscheletui (Détail) ""Papyrus"" Venusmuscheletui (Détail) Boutis Détail Tasche (copyright Kumiko, es ist nur ein Beispiel von Boutis) Hier sind auch Beispiele von Lampenschirmen die ich auch herstelle:Dame en silhouette (Scherenschnitt Technik) Dame en silhouette (Scherenschnitt Technik) ""Couture"" ""Maman"" (Couture) ""Jeanine"" (Couture) Die Herausforderungen liegt daran alles rechtzeitig zu anfertigen, denn ich arbeite alleine und betreibe meine Firma neben einen Vollzeit Job.

By that, we mean not only our own children, but all children, born as well as unborn. That is what sustainability is all about.Most people try to contribute in various ways to reducing our environmental footprint. For 99%* of us, one obvious way is by sorting and recycling our garbage. But still about 2/3** of the residual waste are poorly sorted or not sorted at all, stuff that could have been sorted and left to recycling instead. To many, recycling is a messy and sticky job. It takes a lot of time and commitment to keep our garbage in the kitchen, then carry it out and empty it, before cleaning our hands and recycling containers.  I'm convinced we can get people to recycle more and do it more efficiently. That is what green lizzie® is about - make recycling easier, quicker and more hygienic. And a lot more stylish. In short, a more positive experience. That is our contribution. Olov Mattsson We have proven prototypes, patent as well as patents pending, design protection and registered trademarks.We have interviewed more than 700 people, so we know that there is a demand for our recycling equipments. We have offers from manufacturers and so we know what it will cost to move forward. What we lack are tools for injection moulding. The money we hope to raise with this campaign will go to produce the first series and to manufacture tools for production. By reaching our goal, the production of containers to our supporters will be assured and tools can be procured. We will then also be able to show that this is an area that concerns people and that there is demand a for our solution of recycling containers. That will be a good thing to take with us to the next level - scaling up business. So if you like our recycling containers and think they should exist, please help us start the production and prove that there’s a demand by supporting this project. Many garbage fractions to accommodate, carry away and recycle ? We have a solution to make it easier, quicker and more hygienic. Our patented hooking system let you carry many containers in one hand. Practical when many sorted garbage fractions needs to be carried and transported to the collection point. Hooked to each other containers will not easily turn over when transported back in the car trunk The container is designed to make it possible to empty even into small vertically oriented openings without having to come in contact with the garbage.    The carrier for papers and flyers with stable handles is designed for carrying and emptying heavy paper stacks. The holder for batteries and light bulbs is designed to be emptied into very small openings which often is the case with this kind of waste. It fits in the collar on the multipurpose container.  The multipurpose containers comes in two sizes, Medium and Large. Each of them is easily customized to the kind of garbage it is intended for with the accessories included. With the rail you can hang the container on a vertical surface e.g. the inside of a cabinet door.  The Medium container customized with a bottom grid for continual ventilation (left), good if you have food waste in paper bags. Dense bottom (middle) for e.g. residual waste in plastic bags or bottles and cans. Inner-container (right) suitable for e.g. packages of paper, plastic and metal. Each multipurpose container comes with a collar and snaps which makes it easy to mount the inner container. Designed to fit into cabinets with c-c standard measurements in centimeters. The normal when it comes to the design of products that are for garbage seems to be to hide away and make them as invisible as possible. Our aim has been the opposite, to make them very visible by giving them a design and expression that can stand out and be displayed for the world: ""-this is about garbage and we take good care of it"". Have we succeeded?    - its own expression - designed for recycling every detail, a thought  The manufacturing method is injection moulding. All parts and details are manufactured in thermoplastics. That makes them 100% recyclable into new plastic products***.  Olov MattssonThis is about recycling. I’ve been working with recycling-matters all my professional life, both as entrepreneur and consultant to governements and municipalities. I'm also the inventor and founder of this project. My educational background is industrial and management engineering in which I have a master of science. Katy HoKaty has worked with the design of our recycling containers and also the one who has given them their very own special expression. Her ordinary work is as designer of medical equipment. She has a master of science in design engineering from Ingvar Kamprad Design Center in Lund. Leif PetterssonLeif with his extensive knowledge, experience and network of tools producers is the one who has ensured that it is possible to manufacture effective tools for production of our containers. He is one of the most experienced experts in plastics and tools engineering here in Sweden. He has worked as technical executive officer in one of the biggest plastic manufacturing companies in Sweden. * according to recurrent surveys among Swedish households** according to waste analysis from Swedish households*** that is NOT the case with thermoset plastics as silicon and rubber which can't be formed into new products a second time. This is a project with potential risks and challenges to overcome. Many of them typical for an up starter but some of them I think you as a backer should be aware of. All details will be produced with injection moulding wich is a highly effective voluminous production method. The downside is the cost of tools used in the production. Manufacturing of tools is a very precise craft and it is crucial that our CAD drawings are accurate and the craftsmanship is of high class, especially when it comes to the bigger details. You have surely noticed that this is not an ordinary box or bucket. All details put requirements of logistical coordination of production flows. If not so the lead times will become long and consequently delivery times will not be held which is not a good thing when it comes to internet sales. To minimize risks I have undertaken some steps during the developing process. I have from early beginning enrolled a highly experienced and recognized specialist of manufacturing tools, Leif, who once was the technical director of one of our major plastic manufacturer in Sweden. I will however not build production capacity myself. The production will be held in Sweden, not of any particularly patriotic reasons but we have many skilled subcontractors when it comes to manufacturing plastics and managing logistically demanding production lines. Last but not the least it's also an advantage to me when it comes to basic business culture communication.Olov Mattsson"
A Better Morrissey Birthday Mix|failed|"Last year, a couple friends and I went to a Morrissey/Smiths night that was being held at a local club for Moz' birthday.According to the flyer, there were going to be DJs spinning Morrissey and Smiths records all night.Instead it was just a couple sad, drunk dudes taking turns cueing up songs--most of which weren't even by Morrissey--on a pair of record players.Anyway, I don't want to talk trash.  But, I spent most of the night thinking about all the songs I'd wanted to hear.Better to light a (birthday) candle than curse the darkness, though, right?So, with Moz's birthday coming up again, I was remembering this--and thinking it might be fun to take my own stab at a Morrissey/Smiths mix.What I have in mind isn't too complicated.  Basically, I've been the resident DJ for a trio of clubs in the last few years.  Plus, I have all of the Morrissey and Smith albums.  And my roommate's got most of the singles, B-sides, and imports.Morrissey's output is decidedly different from what I'm used to mixing.  But, that make things interesting (or a disastrous!).  On the whole, I'm not looking to jigger things around too much.  I'd really just like to make a 2 hour mix of tracks that blend into each other.  No crazy effects, no throbbing bass slid beneath ""Sing Your Life,"" nothing too dramatic--just a bunch of songs from throughout the Morrissey and Smiths catalogs, playing through seamlessly.I'm not looking to run afoul of copyright laws or dissuade folks from buying any of the songs.  To that end, the mix won't be available for download.But, if the project is successfully funded, I'll send each of the backers a link where they can stream the mix on-line whenever they like.So, if you're hoping to put it on your Ipod and take it to the gym--you'll be out of luck.But there are other places in which it might come in handy:*If you've got some speakers for your computer and a few friends who are into this, it might make for something you can toss on while entertaining them.*You can bump it in the background, while checking your email.*You can put it on before you go to sleep, and dream of a future when all's well.*You can play it in your bedroom at top volume and dance around alone.  (This is what my roommate does with his B-sides and imports anyway.  And, while I haven't done this in awhile--and it was usually accompanied by Guns N' Roses or Bjork--this might be the mix that changes all of that. )If nothing else, it should make for an alternative to the sort of unhappy birthday party I attended last year.  And that's all I'm hoping for here."
A Ride for Suicide 2015|failed|"In March of 2014 my younger brother took his own life.  The night prior, we talked about riding our motorcycles together on published endurance rides from a respected endurance riding organization.  Less than four hours later, he was dead.  His Harley passed to me.  Since then I have taken the motorcycle on endurance rides in honor of our last conversation. A few months ago I got the idea of making a ride around the USA in an attempt to help bring suicide issues to light.A lot of families tend to keep a death by suicide a hushed thing, something not talked about.  I was conflicted about doing this project, but ultimately keeping suicide a secret, something not talked about, does nothing to help those currently suffering, both their loved ones and those suffering from it's contemplation.  A Ride will be a lap taken around the USA.  Riding endurance runs can be lonely and at the same time friends and strangers will join in the ride.  Depression is lonely, but there are people who will endure it with you.  A Ride will document what endurance riding is like along with interviews of people along the route affected by suicide and their stories.  A Ride will encompass more than 7,600 miles across more than 27 States. Many avid motorcycle riders don't know what an endurance ride like this is like.  The goal is to complete the ride in 14 days, but depending on the interviews, and photos, it may take more days.  The primary goal is getting people's stories out there, the timeline will suffer the goal.  At least two IBA qualifying runs will be made during the Ride.What you're backing is the ride, making a documentary of the ride, interviewing people influenced by suicide along the way (no one will be paid for their story), and the photo book. Along the ride, I'll talk to family members, friends, loved ones, and survivors of suicide.  This isn't just my brother's story, or my story.  It's everyone's story affected by suicide.  I hope in major metropolitan areas 50-100 riders, wearing the same shirt, will be riding down the road and everyone driving around us sees the shirt, the QR code or the website and gets involved.  By getting involved, I mean talking to their loved ones and family, donating to national or local crises centers.  Knowing this is an illness, like cancer, and must be addressed. The route will generally be Omaha, NYC, Jacksonville, San Diego, Seattle, Fargo back to Omaha.  Obviously many cities are between those mile markers.  Along the way, a sign/shirt (the same produced for this project) will be used to promote national prevention sites, crisis centers, where people can donate to those causes, and how people can be interviewed to share their story.  The website will include daily updates of the ride and interviews of people along the way.  This will be a story of people's stories and riding our great country.   It's about survivors of suicide, depression and its effects on families and people, raising awareness to the issue, documenting and showing people what a long haul on the road is like, the effects suicide has on families and friends after their loved ones are gone, and it's not a topic to be hidden or remain a secret. It's not embarrassing, or a secret, it's a tragedy we shouldn't hide just because we don't understand it.The website will be setup as part of this project to encourage people to join the ride or offer to be interviewed to share their story.  The photo book produced will be focused on The Road and where it takes us, the sites and cities across the USA.  It won't be suicide focused, it'll be landscape, motorcycle, and people focused.The finished documentary will be posted on Youtube along with daily videos of the ride and short stories along the ride.  The point of this is to get an issue out there.  Documentaries aren't as popular as entertainment productions, but this will be real people, real life impacts, and a long journey.  The DVD of the project  produced will be a mixture of the ride, the interviews, the prep for the ride, etc.  The goal is to make it about one and a half to two hours.  Depending on the interviews, it could be more.The website will ask those that contemplated suicide to contact me for comment, interview, etc.  My hope is this will save at least one life.  If this project helps prevent even one suicide, it will be a great success.The plan is to start the the ride around the 4th of July and be done around the 18th-20th of July.  A schedule will be posted under the FAQ when it's closer to completion.The breakdown of costs (what you're funding) is the following:1) Fees for funding (Amazon and Kickstarter): $1,2002) Hard costs of the trip (fuel, services [which includes oil changes, tires, wear and tear parts etc.], hotels when I can't couch surf): $3,4003) Blu-Ray production (physically producing the Blu-Ray, contracted): $2,2004) Shirt cost: $5005) Photobook:$1,2006) Taxes on the funding (yep, Uncle Sam get's a piece of this as ""income""): $3,0007) Hardware I don't already have (mounts for cameras for the bike, extra batteries, etc.): $500.  As an update to some requests: here's the routehttps://goo.gl/maps/55KxRAnother way to help with this is to tell your story the effect suicide has had on you.  Message me through Kickstarter.  You can type your story and it can be added to the webside, or you can volunteer to have your story be recorded during the ride.  Obviously with a long ride like this there are risks of wrecks, breakdowns, etc.  They will be overcome, it's part of the project and documentary, it's a journey being documented."
3mm Aluminum Pick Plectrum|successful|Pick Specifications :  For Those Concerned with Strings Safety : Aluminum is a very soft metal. The picks have been tested with hevy abuse on nylon strings, flat wound strings and wound strings. No problem at all! Those who cannot trust can take a simple yet unnecessary step for even safer pick on any strings : with a simple kitchen knife or any knife, start to “ peel “ the pick edges off in the same way like potatoes are peeled off : towards the thumb. Make sure you do not cut yourselves. This way, you will make the pick edges duller. You can dull them as much as you want. You can also dull them with a metal file or, even, with a nail file. The blades of the pick may become rough after you dull with a file. Thus, you are advised to smoothen them up either with a knife as described or with sand paper gradually from as low grid number as you wish to 600 or higher. Please, note : I have managed to cut a flat wound with a steel pick but never with an aluminum pick and I have been playing with these picks ever since I started to make them.  Description : 3mm ( 1 / 8 “ ) Aluminum, Vertically Sharp ( from top to bottom ) Playing Edges  Dimensions : 1 “ ; 1” ; 1 /8 “ ( 2.5cm ; 2.5cm ; 3mm )  Weight : 2g ( 2 grams ), approximately 1 / 16th of an ounce. SUPER LIGHT.  Horizontal Angle : 30 degrees  Playing area : 0.2 to 0.75cm ( Depends on the version : Sharp picks work best with low playing area which gives a sharper vertical angle thus faster playing. )  Features : Bump in the middle to provide a possibility for the vertical angle ( in some rounded versions ) ; vertically and horizontally flat ( except the vertical bump which is smoothened ), angled  Performance : The large horizontal and vertical angles, combined with the slickness of Aluminum give a possibility for fast solo playing. Aluminum is a soft metal and will not cut even nylon strings. Picks perform well and safe on flat wounds. OK on wound strings.  Grip : The pick has a good grip anyways and no other provisions have been made since most people prefer flat picks to avoid discomfort. Because Aluminum is soft, anyone who wants can make grip points just with the edge of a kitchen knife, drill, file or, the easiest and the best, with a pair of vice grips or pliers. The best way to grip a pick, however, is to use this sticky rubber which the banks use to stick the credit cards to the piece of paper. Rubber or other non permanent glue can do just as fine as well as blue tack.  Safety and Environment : Aluminum is a safe element which is neutral and does not react with other elements, just as gold, silver, copper and platinum. Does not rust as well.  Re Shape Ability : Anyone who wants can re shape Aluminum with a file or, even, a knife. However, I think, this is the best shape in the class.  Other : PURE ALUMINUM : no anodisation, no chemical, no electrolytic, no any treatment. Two half holes for extra grip in some versions. Treatment with bicarbonate soda ( baking soda ) may be added for grip but not recommended. Playing tip and blades are polished. Slick and soft. Light. Tone : more like plastic than steel yet as fast as steel. Picks “ adjust “ to the player : the more one plays the better they get : they get slightly polished with playing. No maintenance required. Simple sand paper sanding can be performed should the player desires and is not necessary. The same applies for custom filing : can be done with a simple, inexpensive metal file. Aluminum is very soft thus very easy to customise unlike steel. Polishing with 600 and 1500 sand paper would give best results. For heavily deformed ( impossible under normal use ), filing with a metal file and sanding with approximately : 100, 150, 220, 400, 600 and 1500 can give best results although so many grid increments are not necessary. Yet sand paper is inexpensive and largely available. Steel wool and synthetic steel wool with a grid of 0000 can be used for fine polishing. Strong real wool would give the best results. Do NOT be afraid : none of this is necessary unless the purchaser so desires.  Condition : Brand New : Hand crafted in Canada.  Delivery : Shipping paid by the purchaser. Canada Post have the lowest price. Self addressed and self stamped envelope is necessary. Standard stamp may cover the price. Non registered mail is a risk of the purchaser.  FEEDBACK :  Note : The emails of the people who provided the feedbacks are available upon request to those interested.  J. J., Ottawa :  Hello, Thanks for the picks. I really like them. I like a thick pick, and I noticed a big difference in volume and tone. Much crisper. I really noticed this when I went back for a sound test with the plastic one I normally use. Thanks.  Neil, Ottawa :  I've tried them only on the nylon strings and I'm surprised that the thick aluminum has a similar effect as the 1 mm plastic one I had. More of a jazzy tone. All in all you did a good job of smoothing out the edges.  Thanks Steven. You really know what you are doing. Neil  Connor, Ottawa : Verbally :  I have played these a lot as well as I have given some to friends and colleagues to try and we all like them. These are very fast picks and the tone is very loud. They are very good and a new product which will sell for sure in the future.  Arthur, Ottawa : Verbally :  These picks are excellent. The first versions were very big. Although there are big picks sold in North America and they are standard, most people in North America prefer the standard ones which are approximately 1 “ ; 1 “ and different width.  I have played these picks and I have liked them. The tonal qualities are excellent. I have given these to guitar players and they have all come with an excellent feedback.  I prefer oval picks and not sharp with a bit of a bump in the middle as well as some grip.  The problem is : people do not know them hence you should give them for free first, so people can see their qualities.  The market is very tough on all metal picks but Aluminum is the right material!  Michael, Ottawa :  Verbally :  These are excellent picks. I am sure people would purchase them.  Cassey and Jim, Ottawa :  Via Text :  These are excellent picks. Jim played them for three hours last night and was amazed by the loud and excellent quality tone.  Nick, Ottawa : I like the picks. Crisp and bright.  J., Ottawa : Hi Steven,I haven't had much of a chance to play with them. I like the immediate response to changes in grip strength, and the tone is good : not much of a change from my jazz 3's for hybrid picking etc. There is much less noise from the pick when playing more funk / rhythmic styles, which may or may not be to the players taste. There was no appreciable drag on wound or plain strings, which I was not expecting! It really is effortless picking. I may end up re shaping the “ shoulders “ as I'm used to the Jazz 3's so these are a little bigger, but as you explained that should be no big deal. I'll send you a photo.  Thanks for the trials! No risk. Already made. Huge interest. Can hand make. Best CNC or molded. Looking for a CNC Aluminum manufacturer. Extremely easy and inexpensive to manufacture. 2 cents of material in bulk prises. Can sell for $1.

Tara Normal|successful|Tara Normal can talk to ghosts and she can also punch them. Every day is Halloween in Tara's world.My name's Howie Noel and I'm an illustrator and comic book writer and artist. Since 2009, I've been creating comic mystery stories online starring my character: Tara Normal. Tara is a badass paranormal investigator who not only communicates with ghosts, but she punches them too. Out to solve the mysterious death of her famous novelist mother, Sarah Normal, she must defeat all of the demons, ghouls, werewolves, aliens, rogue government agents and other monsters that stand in her way. My years of research in the paranormal field add an extra level of realism to the extraordinary adventures in the book. When the story begins, Tara has already proven that ghosts exist. This graphic novel explores how her revelation affects the world and the lives of those closest to her. This will be the first in a series of Tara Normal books. I want to explore this character's life completely.This first graphic novel explores St. Catherine of Siena—the most haunted place on the planet. The stars of the struggling paranormal reality TV show, Ghost Soldiers, get trapped in the abandoned mental hospital and it's up to Tara to save them and the day. There are no 'Caspers' in this ghost story. Each ghost is dangerous and Tara's abilities and courage will be put to the test. Tara must go through the asylum to find out what truly happened to her late mother. Special guest star and real life paranormal celebrity Chip Coffey (Paranormal State, Psychic Kids) also makes an appearance to help Tara out.                                                   Real ghost hunting technology but with a science fiction twist.  As an avid ghost hunter, I use real-life paranormal research to add a new spin to the genre. Tara Normal is the official comic of TAPS Paramagazine and both she and I have joined the TAPS crew on several ghost hunts. I've brought Tara to Kickstarter to gain support and complete this epic artistic adventure: to see my vision in glorious color on the printed page. This funding will help me cover printing costs, copyrighting and ISBN fees. Stretch goals will cover distribution fees, marketing and advertising for the title's release. I understand that creating the book is only one part of its success and that distribution and marketing are also extremely important.I want to have the book ready for a debut at Awesome Con in Washington, DC on April 19th, 2014 (which is also my birthday). And I know with your help, we can do this together!  Exclusive rewards just for Kickstarter and just for you!It's almost Halloween, but there are no tricks here. Only treats. Awesome treats. Not like that stale ball of popcorn my neighbors used to hand out on October 31st.To help me achieve my goal, I've set up a ton of cool rewards for you. Awesome rewards include owning a copy of the graphic novel, a Skype session with me while I draw your caricature, and also becoming the lead villain in the next Tara Normal book. That's right: You'll be the main bad guy in the 2nd Tara Normal graphic novel! This book will also include several pages of extras like sketches, the 1st ever drawing of Tara Normal, and a pin-up gallery from some of my talented artist friends.And remember: I will sign EVERY book and I'll draw a custom ghoul sketch in the front.I want you to be a part of my story!One of the cool things about Kickstarter is being able to help a creator reach his goals and make something. I want to offer you a chance to actually be a part of my project and star in my comic books. As a professional caricaturist, I draw people all of the time. Now I'd like to draw you and stick you in this cool graphic novel. You get to actually be a comic book character.A professional fine artist is painting the cover.I am lucky enough to have the amazingly talented fine artist, Kelly Mudge (mudgefactory.com), painting the cover for my new proposed book. Below is the cover she has painted for the new graphic novel.Want more Tara? Here's a way to get more. POWER-UP! ADD ONS!Additional signed Tara Normal book: Add $25 to any reward level.Tara Normal Kickstarter Frankenkitty Shirt: Add $20 to any reward level.Tara Normal Button Up For Mystery Pack: Add $5 to any reward level.Tara Normal sketch by Howie Noel: Add $25 to any reward level.Tara Normal Cameo: Add $100 to the $200 Cameo reward level.To make sure this book gets finished, I need your help. Together we can make this dream a reality. I am focused on telling Tara's story for years to come and sharing her mysteries with you and a whole new audience of readers. Thank you for taking the time to hear about my project and supporting independent artists.The risk for this project is low because I already have the script written and over 50% of the art completed for the book. I handle all of the artwork duties so I don't have to worry about a team member bailing on this project. I've also self-published many works in the past with a (proud to say) 100% completion rating. I've never bailed on a book or a fundraiser before and love making this comic so I'm certainly not going to give up on this. Tara Normal is my passion and this Kickstarter is a way to guarantee I can continue dedicating my time to her world.

I have made tutorial videos before which can be seen for FREE by going to my website (see above)."

Turn your messy Arduino projects into a clean design for 2$|successful|Here's how to turn your messy Arduino projects for only $2.With this card, you can make your Arduino project that can include wireless card like the popular NRF24L01 or WIFI (ESP8266) or Bluetooth HC06. In addition, your project can have a 2x16 LCD, a 4x4 keypad, two servos, a temperature sensor (1-wire) and an internal 3.7v li-po battery. All in one with this customizable PCB. If you consider the time you save for assembling without even thinking to save time of debugging. All that for less than $2 USD!Why using Pro Mini board? Simply because it is the cheapest (about 2$) and the smallest design with Atmega328P. No need USB interface, just use one FTDI to upload your sketch for all of your projects. Top side of the Pro Mini BreakoutBottom side of the Pro Mini BreakoutThis PCB is designed for this version of Pro Mini board (3.3v or 5v)Use this version of Pro Mini board (3.3v or 5v). Note the A6-A7 pinsPro Mini Breakout assembledBottom view with internal batterySpecificationsWith this PCB you can use:Wireless cards NRF24L01 or WiFi ESP8266 or Bluetooth HC06 (one at a time)Supply voltage from 3.3 volts to 12 volts via 1.35mm power jack.Power source: Internal or external LiPo battery or power supply.Popular 2x16 LCD display (HD44780) with backlight and brightness trim .1x4 or 4x4 keypad matrix.2 servos direct pinout connectors.Temperature sensor (DS18S20) or other 1-wire device.Plus:Pull-up resistors for A6 and A7 (if 4x4 keypad used).Configurable voltage jumper (RAW or direct power).1.35mm power jack for supply or charging internal battery.4 analog pins if 1x4 keypad used.8 analog pins if no keypad used.3 digital pins if servos and 1-wire device is not used.Additional digital pin if NRF24L01 is not used.6 digital pins if no LCD is used.Download schematic hereDownload complete datasheet hereSketches examples for using device on the board:LCDLCD + Temp sensor (DS18S20)4x4 keypad4x1 keypadNRF24L01 as receiverESP8266 WiFi cardHC06 BluetoothI offer rewards with passive components to avoid you having to find the right parts that fit perfectly on PCB.With each order, I include the two surface mount resistances  (R1 and R2) because not all electronics enthusiast that have it stock.About Rewards:I offer 3 types of rewards:A - PCB only (available in quantity of 1/4/8/16 pcs)B - PCB with passive components (available in 1/4/8/16 pcs)C - PCB with passive components including LiPo battery (available in 1/4/8/16 pcs)* Based on exchange rate of 1,335% from xe.com on novembre 21th 2015.***Lipo battery charge warning*** As you may have seen in the schematic,  there is no electronic management of the battery charge (current, voltage or time limitation). Therefore the user must be very careful when charging the battery. Always charge the battery from a standard USB port and for a maximum of 45 minutes. Charging LiPo batteries can be dangerous if not done carefully. You should always have an eye on the battery when charging. You should know what you do, so be careful.The biggest challenge for this project was to put most of popular components in a small package to meet the maximum needs of Arduino enthusiasts.
Painting an entire favela in Rio de Janeiro|successful|"We are Haas & Hahn, of the Favela Painting project.Between 2005 and now, the favelas of Rio de Janeiro have provided the inspiration and locations for several public artworks that we painted together with local community members. Each new project being larger than the last, we now we aim to realize our ultimate dream; to plaster and paint an entire hillside favela. With your help we will return to Rio to create this community artwork of unprecedented scale: A monument that will radiate the pride and energy of the people who live in a community that they built with their own hands.sketch for a painted hill in Vila CruzeiroWhen we first visited the favelas in 2005, the way they are built and how they function socially struck us as very beautiful. At the same time they were generally perceived as grim, dangerous and dysfunctional.Our project aims to provide an opportunity for people to transform their own neighborhood from a place seen as negative into a place that is able to communicate its creativity, beauty and innovation to the outside world through art.Favela Painting: Rio Cruzeiro, realized in 2008While painting the houses brings a visual improvement, plastering them helps with controlling moisture, acoustics and temperature. Through training and hiring, jobs are created in places where opportunities are scarce. More people coming to see the artwork will bring new business and employment opportunities for locals.Favela Painters at workVisual beautification, job creation and positive attention boost pride and self esteem and help bridge social gaps in a creative and artful manner. The projects create a voice for the inhabitants, influence public opinion and media, and can help to change perception and remove stigma.Favela Painting: Boy with Kite, 2007//How much do we need?In order to realize this dream, every donation counts: 1 dollar could buy us a brush, 100 dollars pays for 10 gallons of paint. 1000 dollars employs a painter for a full month, including insurance, uniform and lunch.Our minimum goal of $100.000 will enable us to start. We will return to Rio to set up our headquarters and production team, train local youth and get enough materials to start painting and get the Favela Painting project on it's way.But it does not have to stop there. With every extra dollar, more people can be trained and hired and the project can be continued longer. There are hundreds of houses on the hill in Vila Cruzeiro and - if funding is successful - we could paint them all. //locationsatelite image of proposed project site in Vila CruzeiroOur project site is a central hill in the community of Vila Cruzeiro, part of Complexo da Penha in the North Zone of Rio. We spent extensive time creating our first two projects there and lived in the community for several months. We have many friends there and good contacts with all stakeholders and key figures. Visually, the hill offers a perfect geographical location for a monumental effect.//donations and rewardsWe have added a few tiers and rewards to our campaign. Now you can opt for a rewards that will give you a chance to interact with our crew, or to own a part of the actual project. We are sending out used brushes, shirts, flip flops as a memory of Favela Painting. We also offer virtual tours via Skype and penpal relationships with the crew, so you can get personal updates with text and behind-the-scenes snapshots!Everyone donating more than $25 will receive a membership. You will receive updates, exclusive images, videos and first look at new artworks for sale. You also get a cool Kuvva-wallpaperset and receive an optional mention on our backer-list on our website. $50 dollar donations get a set of large postcards and $75 donations get our popular Favela Painting Tee. We added the option to get a shirt that is actually worn in Vila Cruzeiro, complete with paint splatters.Favela Painting ""Pintor"" ShirtHigher tiers receive exclusive Haas&Hahn artwork.Haas&Hahn exhibit at Storefront for Art & Architecture, NYC Donations of $250 receive a beautiful photo by master printer Ruygrok, of either one of our projects (you choose). Backing $500 results in a exclusive-to-the-campaign silkscreen, numbered and signed by Haas&Hahn. The $750 reward is extra special as it's actual production process. During the project, we print our paint plans on hi grade paper. After work we collect all plans - worn and splattered - and signed by both painter and Haas&Hahn. Each one is a different and unique part of the process. Example of paint planAs we hope to raise as much money as possible, we decided to include all these cool artworks (although our agent was not too happy with this idea) with every donation of $1000.Donations over $1000 get something  personal. A private virtual tour, your very own on-site barbecue and even a personal visit by Haas&Hahn. This could mean a lecture, a brainstorm session, or maybe just a few beers. We are pretty flexible, so whatever you wish, we will figure it out!//videomore on the work of Haas&Hahn in this short film by Seven Halsema, narrated by Rich Medina://organization and fiscal sponsorship  ""The Favela Painting Foundation supports the creation of striking artworks in unexpected places. It collaborates with local people to use art as a tool to inspire, create beauty, combat prejudice and attract attention."" It is based in Amsterdam, works independent, and operates in Rio de Janeiro with local representatives.               The Philadelphia Mural Arts Program is pleased to serve as a fiscal sponsor for the Project.  Mural Arts' mission is to unite artists and communities through a collaborative process, rooted in the traditions of mural-making, to create art that transforms public spaces and individual lives.  Philly Painting Project by Haas&Hahn and the Mural Arts ProgramMural Arts has previously collaborated with Favela Painting to create Philly Painting, a major art and economic development project in North Philadelphia.  The organization is excited to remain connected to Haas&Hahn as they undertake this new Project.  During their time in Brazil, the artists will serving as ambassadors for the work they did with Mural Arts and will create opportunities for members of our staff to travel and learn about the Project while it is underway.Mural Arts is exempt from any responsibility pertaining to the planning, management of completion of the Project.  Favela Painting is wholly accountable to those who support the Project.  Donors contributing to the project via Kickstarter will not be eligible to receive a tax benefit in exchange for their gift, and should not expect acknowledgment from Mural Arts.  Mural Arts is not responsible for unfulfilled benefitsAlthough we have vast experience working in Rio de Janeiro, the city can sometimes hold unexpected surprises. If for any reason it becomes too challenging or unsafe to execute the project in the planned area of Vila Cruzeiro, we will relocate to an equally visually stunning alternative location and still fulfill all project goals as described. Our projects have never gone exactly as planned, but have always yielded results greater than expected. We are flexible, dedicated and work with a great team. We're excited and ready to go."

I am already dreaming of what sounds I will be able to make there.""  Alvin Lucier, composerThe TANK is an acoustical marvel and a sonic wonder of the world, with a shifting, swirling reverberation longer and richer than the Taj Majal or the Great Pyramid. The 65’ tall, 40’ wide empty steel water tank that was discovered in Rangely, Colorado by sound artist and sonic thinker Bruce Odland in 1976 became a place where a small group of musicians and sound artists recorded their music for decades.By 2012, The TANK was in danger of falling silent: No more music, no more sound; rusting and decaying in the elements; left to dust, weather, vandalism, and neglect. To answer this urgency, Friends of The TANK was born, and a “SAVE The TANK” Kickstarter campaign was launched — and funded — in 2013.The immersive experience of The TANK encourages visitors to learn about sound from within.Free to experiment with sounds, movement, and cause-and-effect, these students, on entering The TANK for the first time, come to  listen in a different way​ and​ to understand the mathematics of space through the poetry of the 40 second reverberation. A truly multidisciplinary learning can take place, all while ""playing"" The TANK.   Thanks to almost 800 backers from around the world, The TANK was saved as a world class reverberant space and valued musical resource for all to share.Tom Wasinger and Cameron McCoin relax on the porch with neighbors and friends.In the three years since achieving our first Kickstarter goal, we have accomplished everything we promised to do in that campaign — and much, much more:We were granted our Change of Use Permit from Rio Blanco County; Electrical service was installed to The TANK and control room; Lighting was added, inside and out; Local volunteers built a new access road; Friends of The TANK became a 501c3 charitable organization; The TANK GAMELAN was created from a knee-high pipe that used to bisect The TANK; A ventilation fan was installed without changing the acoustics of The TANK; New parking lots were added for visitors; A safety fence was strung along the cliff; Rhino Cubed (in Boulder) built our new recording studio from a shipping container; Local supporters delivered the recording studio on the back of a flat bed truck; The recording studio/control room was settled on a vibration-cancelling, Crocs-filled foundation next to The TANK; The new, full-size door was designed and cut by volunteer metal workers; An accessible wooden deck was built to welcome visitors, and to link The TANK to the recording studio; A freshly painted floor invites everyone to take off their shoes and move about the space; Our Occupancy Permit from the county was awarded in September 2015; We were able to give our first legal concert at The TANK Open House during Rangely's Septemberfest 2015; Twelve homeschool students came to The TANK to help us test-run our school outreach program; The Flobots stopped in Rangely to play in The TANK on their recent ""deTour"" of Colorado.        .soundcloud .card {          max-height: 250px;        }        .soundcloud .embedly-card iframe.embedly-card {          height: 220px;        }        .card iframe[title~=SoundCloud] {          height: unset;        }       THE GOALWe're back on Kickstarter because it’s time to OPEN The TANK as a fully operational Center for Sonic Arts!The crowdfunding community, including 751 sound lovers and acoustical pioneers from around the world, made it possible to SAVE The TANK.

Reed - Bringing Tablet Reading Up to Speed|failed|The ProblemThough there are thousands of styluses available for your tablet, there is currently no non-capacative tool to allow you to read quickly and effectively without accidentally turning pages. For this reason, studies have shown that tablet reading is up to 30% slower than print reading. Reed aims to fix this.The ProductReed (named after the college where Steve Jobs famously learned about typography) is the world's first tablet reading utensil. Made with soft microfiber, it cleans as you read. Using a built-in ridge, it is easy to grip and move effortlessly along the screen of your tablet. For users with iPad devices, Reed will snap onto the outside of your smart cover to prevent loss. Most importantly, it will not interfere with the memory or auto-locking feature of your tablet, and is safe to use with any tablet, desktop computer, or laptop.Reed has both a soft and a sharp edge; you can use whichever suits you. It is lightweight and can easily be hand-washed. The ProjectYour funding will help us set up a more professional method of production right here in California. Doing so would allow us to uniformly manufacture Reed with higher quality a more polished finished product. To do this, we will need to order custom die-cut inserts. This requires a minimum order quantity. We also will need a more sophisticated sewing machine, and will be hiring someone to operate it at fair market wages. Lastly, we will need pay the setup fees to have a more professional packaging solution printed and manufactured, which is most economical at 1,000 units or more. Depending on the success of this Kickstarter Project, we may also be able to use the funds to set up an e-commerce website, or to hire a sales representative part time to pursue major retailers. All of this and more is only possible with your generous pledge.Help us bring tablet reading up to speed by making Reed a reality today. 
Flags of the world|failed|Hi , thanks you for taking the time to visit my project page.With the money I raise from Kickstarter, I am planning on buying materials such as canvases, paint, and paintbrushes. I also want to pay for advertising on facebook and in magazines in Savannah, GA, and rent a gallery space for the show. My plan is to create about 5 large scale flag paintings and as many 10x10 inch paintings as I can create (hopefully over 100). The more I raise for the project, the bigger and better the outcome will be! Everyone that donates can message me telling me what flag they want. it has to be a flag of a country. feel free to contact me if you have any questions about the project or the rewards. http://www.facebook.com/pages/Roque/186683198029250
Mover Kit: get kids moving, building & coding|successful|Our Kickstarter campaign has ended, what a journey! Thank you SO MUCH to each and every one of you, you have been a huge part of the next step for Technology Will Save Us. We’re now busy producing your Movers, painting rainbow snap bands, packaging everything and getting the coding platform ready for your awesome inventions! You can stay up to date with the Mover journey by signing up to our email updates.Forbes’ Toy to Watch in 2016“This DIY wearable aims to make kids fearless about technology” — The Verge“The Mover is a STEM toy, for sure, but it’s also a Trojan Horse for getting kids started on computational thinking” — Wired“Youngsters can gamify everyday tasks such as brushing their teeth or make sports activities more fun” — LSN:Global“This kit isn’t just about building – the real creativity lies in the fact kids can decide what the rules are themselves and make and code them” — ForbesWhat is the Mover Kit?The Mover Kit is an intuitive way for kids ages 8 and over to learn the fundamentals of electronics, programming and solve problems creatively. It encourages kids to learn by doing what they do best - being active and playing! Right now we are production ready and are turning to you, the Kickstarter community, to get the Mover Kit into the hands of kids everywhere.As seen on...We've had such wonderful reviews already from BBC News, Fast Company, Forbes, Wired, The Verge, BoingBoing, Wall Street Journal, Cool Mom Tech, Creative Review and Geek Dad!How it worksYou build it yourself: Straight out of the box, kids (and parents!) can connect the electronics, case, and accessories together to build their very own Mover Kit. It’s as simple as making a LEGO house or paper airplanes – but way cooler.~ BUILD IT ~Move it to bring it to life: Slap it on their wrist, attach it to their scooter, make a disco necklace. Running with the dog, spinning in the backyard, dancing with dad, scooting to school and exploring outside are just some ways to learn and play with the Mover Kit.~ MOVE IT ~Code your own games: Kids can then invent their own apps on the Mover Kit by programming the motion sensor (accelerometer), compass (magnetometer) and rainbow lights (LEDs) with our online platform called Make, designed specifically for kids to make and code. You can program it with up to three different apps at any one time.~ CODE IT ~Help us reach our stretch goal: $125K!Yes, you're reading that right: RAINBOW SNAP BANDS! If we reach $125,000 we will give ALL BACKERS rainbow snap bands for their Mover Kits.

Exercise and movement are the best way to ensure healthy brain activity and we even learn better when we move! There’s a gap between boys and girls in technology: In the 2014 Digital Makers Report, the National Endowment for Science Technology and the Arts (NESTA) found that “76% of girls are interested in digital making, but less interested in learning about technology for its own sake”. We wanted to create something that inspired both boys and girls. There’s not enough making and coding together: Over the last 3 years of making with thousands of kids and parents, we have learned that when you introduce coding alongside crafting and making, it boosts confidence and enthusiasm, leaving kids wanting to learn more.People Will Save Us!We launched Tech Will Save Us after we worked for many years in education and design realized it wasn’t moving fast enough for the pace of tech. We also have a child, who was basically born with an iPad, we wanted him to have experiences that were productive and creative with technology not just consuming it.

The VolksDangler: Hack your pockets|successful|"The concept is simple.  Taking the best elements from the original GearPull and the Mini-D, I've created a 3rd (and final) generation product with a slimmer profile, better price point, and improved tensile properties.  The VolksDangler is the peoples' dangler.  Just attach keys and/or pocket gear and use the VolksDangler to suspend everything in your pocket or bag.  You can now access all your gear in a split second without having to search for it.  The ""deluxe"" models come with 5 premium clips which the Volksdangler has been designed to accommodate.When you choose to back this campaign you join an intrepid group of like-minded people who will be the first to experience the VolksDangler....but your reward is only half the story. Thanks to your faith and support, independent makers like myself can subvert the corporate model. Every backer helps to usher in a new form of commerce that brings the power directly to the consumer, and permits makers to set their own terms and succeed on their own merit. In addition to having my deep gratitude and respect, here is what you have to choose from in return for backing my project.  It's fine if you want multiple rewards, read how in the FAQ at he bottom of this page.Glow slot enhancement is available for Rewards 1, 2, 3 & 4 as an ""ADD ON"" for an additional $14. Adjust your pledge accordingly if you want green or blue glow.Material:Titanium: Titanium is a sought after material for EDC gear because of its startling strength to weight ratio.  The finish on these is an even and consistent satin grey with low gloss highlights. Stealth Finish: All Stealth units are flat ""Armor Black"" Cerakote over titanium. This is an extremely durable, premium finish mostly used for firearms and is well suited to the rigors of pocket carry. Though it will never fade, peel or flake, it will slowly wear at the high points over time.   All of  the Cerakote is done by Jeff Forbush.  Google ""4bushwrs"" if you want to learn more about his services. Mokume gane: In these examples of this exotic material, copper and nickle-silver are heated, laminated and forged to create beautiful patterns  resembling wood grain or cloud formations.  Each piece is as unique as a fingerprint. The copper will patina as you carry it, enhancing the contrast. That alchemical process is part of what makes Mokume such a pleasure to possess over time.  All the Mokume blanks are fabricated by Mike Sakmar. Google ""Sakmar Enterprises"" if you want to learn more about his services. Glow Slots:  These are available as an ""add on"", if you want a glow slot installed you must increase your base pledge amount by $14.   An extra slot is cut in the toe of the VolksDangler and carefully filled flush by hand. Choose from either ""Ultra Green"" which is brighter and glows for 24 hrs., or ""Ultra Blue"" which glows for 9hrs. Both require just 10 minutes of charging. Your Support is Critical:If you like my work please share this campaign on your preferred social network, or even just share a link with one friend you think may be interested.   The best major social platform you can use to help promote the VolksDangler is Instagram, please consider posting this campaign on your feed, and follow @gamblemade for real time updates from my shop. I'll be working to capacity every day while the campaign is live to get the word out, so any promotional support you may be inspired to provide would be deeply appreciated.  All proceeds will go into fulfilling the promises of this campaign first, and then into purchasing a surplus of parts from my suppliers and collaborators so I can keep it all going after the rewards have been fulfilled.  Another portion will be funneled back into research and development.Each Mokume VolksDangler is as unique as a fingerprint.Shipping & Delivery:Your VolksDangler will be shipped according to the schedule detailed in the rewards summary on the right of your screen. Basically, you will have yours in hand no later than Nov 31st, 2015. Fulfillment takes as long as it does because I personally grind and form every dangler.  In my past two campaigns every shipping deadline was met, and I'm prepared to do it again. Backers of this campaign will be the first to experience The VolksDangler, as they will not be for sale to the general public until every reward has been fulfilled. US backers get theirs delivered free of charge via 1st class parcel post with delivery confirmation; international shipments only cost $8, and go out via international parcel. Shipping to Canada is $7.The GearPull Family of Danglers.Thanks again to those who backed the original GearPull and the Mini-D here on Kickstarter, none of what I do today would be possible without your enthusiasm and support.  Thanks as well to those of you who are new to my work, please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.  limitless possibilitiesI've already established firm relationships with my United States collaborators for this project and have tried my best to prevent every foreseeable problem. I am an obsessive planner, and while I can't prevent every problem, I do have the temperament, experience and integrity to deal with whatever happens in a professional manner. I promise to be transparent, and keep everyone informed with comprehensive monthly updates regarding the progress of the project before and after the funding deadline. There's no pretending that every aspect of a project of this scope will go smoothly, but my backers will be the among the first to know if there are any issues.Thanks again, and please wish me luck!"

the mailboxes forthcoming album!|successful|Well, the time has finally come to record an album of my songs! I've been anticipating this for a while now and I'm so excited that it's finally happening! Over the past year I've been asked to play more and more shows around the Cleveland and Chattanooga area and so many people have asked me for recordings, but I didn't have anything to give! Now, my album is going to be a reality and I can't wait. Several people have offered to record my music, but I've really been clueless about how to make it happen. I didn't want to jump into anything I didn't feel sure about. Thankfully my brother Justin is also a musician and has some friends who are willing to help me out! Stephen Nichols has a wonderful studio in Chattanooga we will be using to record during the first 2 weeks of August. My brother Justin and his friend Randy Cantrell are also going to help me out with arranging music as well as playing various instruments on the album. Using the studio is going to cost $300 a day so we have a ways to go before we have all the money we need to fund this album! We then will also need money to master the tracks and then find a way to package it and put it into the hands of all my lovely supporters who want to hear more tunes from The Mailboxes! Thank each and every one of you for your love and support! There's no way I could do this without you and anything you can give will help. Thank you thank you thank youuuu! <3 Jillian

German technology quickly leaped ahead several decades and the Nazis won the war before America could intervene. According to legend, in 1938 an expedition to Tibet led by members of the Thule Society discovered SOMETHING that allowed them to accelerate the speed at which new weapons were developed. Shortly after, the discovery of the moon mineral Lunarium, a new powerful fuel source, gave their technology a huge advantage over the Allies.""Zeppelin Fleet...2039?""In support of their armies, the Nazis also attacked in Zeppelins that flew in the stratosphere, so high that even the newest Allied fighter planes could not reach them.

Every single bit of support makes a HUGE difference and will push Rocket Ranger closer to victory! FIGHT THE FUTURE!""So, we place our fate in your hands."" ""We cannot predict how your actions will affect the future - in fact, our own lives may no longer exist in the altered world that results. But we see no other way to stop this Thousand Year Blight - and it must be stopped! We have given you the power to change history and save humankind...My God! The Gestapo is at the door ... goodbye and good luck!""  >>> END TRANSMISSION. FUNK UNTERBROCHEN. STOP.<<<Rocket Ranger Reloaded goes one step beyond the work we did on Wings! Remastered Edition. It will be a larger, more complex project that will require more resources due to its highly non-linear game structure. High replayability is one of our aims with this game and this requires a lot more content to be created.In addition, we are completely overhauling the visual presentation and art direction of the game, many of the original game sequences, including introducing brand-new gameplay mechanics. These objectives will take time and resources to develop and fine-tune properly in order to meet our fans' expectations, as a lot of experimentation and trial & error is involved. Our community's involvement (and patience) will be crucial to this project's ultimate success.We truly hope we can raise more than the minimum funds to fully realize the vision for Rocket Ranger Reloaded. It is a title that deserves a lot of care and attention to detail, like all Cinemaware titles. Ultimately, it is YOU who will decide how far this project can go and how Rocket Ranger will be able to FIGHT THE FUTURE!"
Write my Estimate - have your estimate written anywhere!|failed|Ashford Estimating Services writes professional estimates for contractors of all trades, all over the country. Our app concept will streamline the documentation process for contractors.Companies will be able to add their customer information to created files. Within these files contractors will be able to add photos, scope notes of damage, insurance paperwork, invoices, etc.Compiling all this information allows for a more detailed estimate to be prepared. Once all information is collected, contractors can then send the file to our server, where we can access this information and prepare the estimate on the contractors behalf.Once the estimate is prepared, we send it back to the app. Notifications will be sent to individual devises. Here contractors can review the approve or reject the estimates. Our biggest obstacle will be the development. We want the app to be as user friendly as possible, so that anyone could use it to their advantage. We want the app to have all the aspects that contracts of all trades will find useful in their day to day work life.Once development is complete, there should be no issue. Ashford Estimating Services would first market the app to our already existing customers for use. It will travel from there!!

So You Like the Neighborhood|successful|"WHAT'S IT ABOUT?""So You Like the Neighborhood"" is an offbeat crime thriller/comedy. It's based on something that happened to me last summer. It tells the story of a girl who is being evicted from her Brooklyn apartment of 12 years. She goes to drown her sorrows at a nearby bar. There she befriends some locals, who offer to help her with the eviction. They just so happen to be former mafia members, and by ""help,"" they mean something more nefarious. WHY CONTRIBUTE?Making films, even short films, is insane-oh expensive. Especially in New York City! Even when you try and do things on the cheap, it adds up fast! For an aspiring director, a strong short film can be hugely instrumental for professional growth and exposure. Shorts are the first step in the journey of forging a career in film directing. Your help, however small, is invaluable in this process. WHERE YOUR MONEY WILL GOThis is a micro-budget movie, and shooting in New York City is tough and expensive. My cast and crew is working for free, on a deferred basis, or at drastically reduced rates. NYU provides some resources to help bring down the cost, but there are still many expenses that require your support!These include: Cast, Crew, food, permits, Locations, equipment trucks, camera lenses, Hair & Make-up, Sound Mixing and Sound Design, Grip & Electric Rentals, etc. etc. DIRECTOR'S STATEMENT""So You Like the Neighborhood"" combines suspense, sarcastic humor, thoughtful eccentricity and the threat of violence. It is ultimately a story about unlikely friendship and taking responsibility in one's life.I like to mine for the humor inside dark, sinister worlds, and to infuse all of my films with comedic elements. A film with a similar tone would be Scorsese’s ""After Hours.""Visually I like to use muted colors and pools of shadow. I love creating creepy soundscapes (whale mating calls being a personal favorite); worlds where there is always something nightmarish lurking outside; worlds that are missing the moral framework necessary for producing your typical heroes.

HUUUGE THANK YOU to Matt Hengehold of Hengehold Trucks for letting us borrow one of his 11' step vans until the end of June!

a restaurant going against the grain in colchester essex|successful|The oldest recorded town in Britain! Something anyone from Colchester will almost certainly tell you if you ever give them just half a chance. Something to be proud of maybe? Unfortunately it seems the food in the town centre might be vying for the same title (except noodle bar. if you know, you know). Yes, the town centre has 'the chains' and a fair few places to get that guilty (but so good) burger after a night out, even a swanky new hotel to go and posh it up at, but let's be honest that's about it! Hardly blazing a culinary trail are we.  Could it be we're getting left behind?Our FoodThat's where we come in. grain. Yes a pretentious one word restaurant name, is going to change all that.  We are going to redefine how a restaurant in Colchester operates.  No more of the boring, run of the mill menus.  Instead we're going to offer modern British food, small plates all starter sized and all priced that way.  Of course fresh, of course the best we can produce and of course as local as we can get, that is the promise we aim to fulfill at grain.  So instead of the usual, getting stuck with the 3 courses you settled for, have 4, have 5, have 6, have the whole menu if you want. After all variety (not nutmeg) is the spice of life. Then leave feeling full, satisfied and not wondering if you missed out on the 'other' dessert the table next door had. With money left in your wallet or at least invested in a nice bottle of red rather than in the 'discretionary' service charge we're all too polite to refuse nowadays.The ExperienceWe want you to feel comfortable. There'll be no front of house/back of house divide, the people that cook your food will serve your food, one team completely immersed in every aspect of making grain tick. A dedicated bunch of multi skilled, uber-passionate hospitality professionals.  Trained in some of the top restaurants in the area and across Europe, we're talking about top quality food (or at least the best we can muster) in a comfortable, relaxed environment.  You can have a chat with the chef that cooked your meal, indulge in some top drawer cooking, enjoy a bottle of quality wine (or two) or discover a new craft beer and above all else feel at home from the minute you walk in to the time you leave.Who are we?Paul Jordan (Sid)Chances are you won't know us, but we are committed to making grain happen. It all started with a shared vision working together 3 years ago, wanting to open a restaurant we wanted to eat in, serving top end food, our food, without all the stuffy pretentiousness that normally goes with it.  We're passionate about doing things our way, and it just happens our way meant throwing the rule book out the window.  But we're still conventional chefs, we'll be using local produce, making everything fresh, from scratch to the highest standard and in time we hope to work with the community and support not just the local trades but also you, if your allotment is overstocked with tomatoes or you have a garden full of chickens laying eggs, let's talk. We want the people of Colchester to feel part of the project too. Let us turn your hard earned efforts in to something fantastic and sharing the rewards from it.Where does Kickstarter come in?Now we've kind of fallen on our feet.  After years of graft and hard saving it just happens a property came on the market. In our home town of Colchester. In the town centre. In good enough condition that it's almost ready to go. So, we scraped together every penny we have between us (£30000), did a little creative borrowing from the bank (£25000) and we just about have enough to open.  But we don't want to just 'open' we need just a little lift from you. To enable us to make grain the restaurant experience we always imagined.  So the £10000 we hope to raise through kickstarter will give us the funds to stock the wine shelves, fill the fridges, buy the pots, the pans, the cups, the plates, the knives, forks and spoons. Generally to make sure we're 100% ready to give you the experience we think you deserve.The RewardsThe beauty of Kickstarter is it's not a charity.  You're not just giving us your money.  You're buying something from us, the moment you pledge your money (if we're successful) you're a customer at grain: a restaurant that will exist, by hook or by crook by the end of the summer.  Just look at it as pre payment, and how nice is it to think that at some point you'll get to come and have a meal and perhaps a few drinks and not have to worry about the bill at the end of it (because lets face it, that's the part everyone hates regardless of cost)Anyone that knows a thing or two about the restaurant trade will know its tough.  The hours, the stress, the surrender of social life - but we're used to that, unfortunately so are our loved ones.But the reality is a very high percentage struggle to make it past the first year and even less make it past five.  Its a sobering statistic but we've considered it, done our research, crossed our t's and dotted our i's and we're confident we can make it work on our business plan in the current market.  It will be tough but we're ready for every challenge it throws at us, more to the point we're looking forward to conquering them and for our customers to be part of the journey and grow with us.Something else to consider is this is going to be our first restaurant and that will only add to the challenge.  Professionally we are up to the challenge. We've amassed the skills we need to run a successful restaurant, we've even opened one or two for other people.  Along with the contacts we have developed in our careers and friends in the industry that are already offering their support along the way so we certainly don't feel like we're doing this alone.Yes there will always be competition, yes there will inevitably be somewhere newer or cheaper to eat, we know that.  But we are offering something different, somewhere everyone can feel comfortable, where the food is as good as if not better than anywhere in the area, run by people who genuinely care about their craft and their customers. We're confident we'll go from strength to strength with you.
Bull & Dragon's Pop-Up Restaurant Project|failed|"Fresh Diver ScallopsTo channel my voracious appetite for learning and innovation, my company “Bull & Dragon LLC” will be hosting a series of Pop-Up restaurants over the course of the next couple of months. We are EXTREMELY excited by this opportunity to share my cuisine, our brand of hospitality, and create a unique dining experience. To do this, we have put together three concepts for Bull & Dragon's Pop-Up restaurant series in Venice, California.What is a Pop-Up restaurant you might ask? Pop-Up restaurants are creative dining concepts that temporarily ""Pop-Up"" as innovative events in fun interesting locations. So, here’s the scoop! We’ve created three menus (included below) and contributors will be allowed to vote on which menu/concept they’d like us to produce first. Each menu/concept will run for two to three weeks at a cool location on the west side of Los Angeles (probably Venice) depending on your feedback. At the end of this series, our team will put together a cookbook documenting the dishes served at all three concepts! The first menu in the series will ""Pop-Up"" about 30 days after funding is reached. The other two will follow, each about three weeks apart. The cookbook will be released about 30 days after the end of the last Pop-Up in the series. BouillabaisseBraised Short RibTHE MENUS:Seasoned Tomahawk RibeyeStuffed BranzinoOur goal is to provide a really cool unique dining experience, and document it with a cookbook! These extremely focused concept menus are each divided into three sections (Starters, Share Plates, and Entrée). We will offer a three-course tasting menu (one selection from each section, serves one), a four-course tasting menu (adding a fourth selection from the entrée section, serves two), or a nine-course tasting menu for two (which will include ALL nine dishes per menu)! The donations will be used for such things as plates, silverware, conceptual ambiance and cooking equipment. Most importantly though, they will be used to purchase amazing product from the ranchers, farmers, and seafood providers we’ve developed relationships with over the years. All produce will be farmer sourced non-GMO and organic! All meat will be range-fed (or wild) hormone and antibiotic FREE! Only the best will do…Contributors will be added to our preferred guest list and made aware of Pop-Up dates, times, and locations. Contributors will also be given first chance at selecting dinner reservations for the Pop-Up(s) they'd like to attend. If contributors donate at a level in which a tasting dinner is part of their rewards, contributors will be able to decide which menu/concept they'd like to redeem their dinner at. The restaurant/hospitality industry faces a TON of challenges, we live by Murphy's Law. That being said, we expect things to go awry, and do our best to come up with solutions ahead of time.The biggest challenge will be preparing the locations. There are quite a few challenges that go along with the logistics of food service. We have negotiated with a few different locations which have incredible potential, however anything can happen when organizing logistics and creating a magical experience. :) This is the biggest reason why the first Pop-Up will ""Pop-Up"" about 30 days after funding. This period will give us time to add any necessary equipment, dress up the chosen location and prepare for any ""unforeseen"" curveballs. The second biggest challenge will be product-sourcing. Wild, seasonal, and local farmer-sourced product is of the utmost importance to us. This means that the menus may have to be adjusted slightly due to availability of product. I do promise that any changes will reflect the integrity of the original dish and menu concept.Our team has over 70 years of combined experience in the hospitality industry. We've become pretty good at thinking on our feet...We are VERY EXCITED to have you as our guest!Our promise to you is an amazing and unique dining experience :)"

Stage one & Stage two Music theatre|failed|When I was a child there was only one place to see a movie and that was the Tradewinds Theater. it only had 2 screens but it was right down the street, and something to look forward to on friday. As i got older a mall was built on the outskirts of town which had 12 screens but was so far away that we didn't go nearly as often but it was able to put the Tradewinds out of business. A church and Opry house occupied the building for a few years but now it has been vacant for 12 years now. I love movies and i love music the were a big part of my upbringing. So my plan is to buy the property outfit it for concerts on the weekend; play movies Preferably older blockbusters like jaws or ghostbusters ect, or standup during the week, i intend on putting a kitchen in so meals my be served. I also plan on building a nightclub spanning the space between auditoriums with 2 green rooms and a music recording studio. The entry will resemble an old styled theater with  balcony seating. This place is a warm part of our towns history and is rather see it restored instead of it being torn down.AS if raising the money isnt hard enough, i will need to get license for food, alcohol, I will have to employ and train ppl the building will need to be renovated. permits from the city will need to be obtained for the loud Music.  and advertising need must be met
Phochron XA Film Camera Shutter Speed Tester|successful|"Camera testing made simpleIn the last few years, there has been a surge in popularity of older, film based camera equipment. Many photographers have been making a move back to film, or experimenting with film to broaden their creativity.A folding camera from the 30'sVintage and classic cameras are more popular than ever, and almost every one that is offered for sale on the big auction sites is quickly snatched up by collectors and users alike. Prices are actually starting to rise as demand is outpacing the supply. Many times, neither the buyer or seller has any idea whether the camera is working, and will advertise that it is sold as ""untested"". I feel that there is a need for the camera collector, user, or dealer to be able to test a key component of the camera: the shutter. Let's face it, a camera is simply a light tight box that has a sophisticated mechanical shutter inside. The shutter is the second most important part of making a proper exposure, next to the lens. This is why I decided to design and build the Phochron XA shutter speed tester. I wanted a quick and simple handheld device that within minutes could tell me whether the shutter is operating up to spec, or if it is time for repair. Many times you can compensate for a slow shutter (most older shutters run slow) by changing the film type or the aperture settings. Consistency of shutter timing is critical too. So many I've tested show very inconsistent shutter times. Here's a 1950's Bessa folding camera being tested What kind of cameras can be tested?If your camera has access to both sides of the shutter, it can be tested. Unfortunately, most modern digital (DSLR) cameras have no access to the back side of the shutter as that is where the sensor is located. Because of this, they cannot be tested with my product. Box cameras, view cameras, toy cameras, large format, and ""point and shoot"" cameras can be tested easily with the Phochron XA. Polaroid cameras can be tested as long as you can get to both sides of the shutter. Shutter speeds as fast as 1/8000th can be measured. Yes, this tester is designed for a limited audience, since digital cameras are now the norm. Analog photography is definitely a big part of the art, as evidenced by the popularity of Lomography, the Impossible project, and many film making manufacturers starting to run their film lines again. Big names like Leica, Voigtlander, and Nikon are still producing and selling film cameras.It is not the goal of this kickstarter campaign to get everyone to throw away their digital equipment and buy a 70's era Canon AE1, but for those of you that have caught the film bug, this tester is one gadget you really need.  Check out this quick video showing how you can test a box camera shutter in two minutes:What is the difference between the basic tester and the deluxe tester?The basic tester has a single built in light sensor on the front panel. It can test EVERY type of shutter, even curtain types found in SLR cameras.  The deluxe tester adds an external plug-in module that has two sensors and allows for taking measurements at both edges of the film plane of a 35mm single lens reflex. This is an easy way to check for consistent and even travel of both the opening and closing curtains. This gives you more detailed analysis of a more modern curtain type shutter than the simple tester. However, both the basic and the deluxe kit can test 35mm SLR type shutter systems.Here's an image of the front panel and the built in sensor in the center. The jack to the left is for connecting the external sensor module. here's a front and back view of the dual sensor module showing the selector switch to select which pair of sensors is used in the testingWith the basic tester you can quickly  test all sorts of cameras:Simple cameras such as Holga, Agfa, Lomo and old box cameras,Kodak instamatics, folders, miniatures, HIT and toy cameras Any SLR camera such as Nikon, Canon, Pentax, Contax, and Minolta,  Any TLR camera such as Rollei, Yashica, Argus, and Mamiya,  Any rangefinder camera such as Retinas, Yashicas, and Canonet  All medium format camera like Hasselblad, Bronica, Mamiya, Rolleiflex, Pentacon Six, etc., And even shutters from Large Format cameras.Some Leica and Russian cameras, as long as you can access both sides of the shutter.Point and shoot, and APX camerasThis is just a partial list... many, many more can be tested.Also measures flash durationThis tester can also measure the duration of a flash pulse. After trying it with various electronic flashes, I can see huge differences in the ""light time"" of  each of  the flash units. The sensor design can resolve pulses as short as 1/10,000 sec (100 micro-seconds long) as evident by the calibration check mode, so flash pulses this short can be viewed and recorded.Here's another video showing a quick test on a Ricoh SLR camera using the built-in sensor.And here's my latest video showing testing of a medium format Bronica SQ A modelTo learn moreI'm not going to fill up this space explaining all that the Phochron XA can do. For a full description, FAQ, and many photos, go to my website: www.phochronxa.com  If you are convinced that this test set will meet all of your testing needs, please return to back my project.I have fully working prototypes and I'm ready to launch production. That's where I need your help. I'd like to raise enough funds to build the first couple hundred of these testers. As a reward for helping me bring this to production I can offer a generous discount. I do plan to offer the Phochron XA after the kickstarter project is over, but not at this discounted price. sample screen of single sensor testing Sample screens showing dual sensor testingFeatures:built-in single sensor measures speeds up to 1/8000th secbuilt-in LED light sourceAA battery powered with auto power down2.2"" color LCDdisplays an oscilloscope style waveform of sensor signalgives average time as well as min/max timesoptional external sensor for measuring SLR curtain shuttersreports curtain times as measured at both ends of film planebuilt-in user manual with photospocket size"

We need to pay for actors and locations and camera equipment. We're absolutely thrilled to have met our original goal! Now we're pushing for $20,000 so we can make the book even better. The more money we raise, the more incredible and magical the book will be. We want to inspire a generation of kids to be brave and learn to face their fears, so let's give it all we've got. Additional money raised will go toward the production of the images and allow for better printing, so everyone that backs the book benefits. Let's do this! Update 7/4: New Pictures!We've been hard at work making new images and finishing up the storyline for the book. Here's a little scene that didn't make the cut, with some adorable lettering and doodles by Valerie Navarro.   Who We AreHi! We're Mitch (human) and Vivian (dog), and together we're making ""Vivian the Dog Moves to Brooklyn,"" a children's book about a big dog moving to the ""big city."" Mitch is the writer and photo-illustrator, and Vivian plays the part of the adorable giant dog.In our five years together, we've moved around a lot—four states, five cities, and 10 different apartments or houses. We've been in Brooklyn for two years, and love it, so we're settling down ;). No matter how many times you move, it's always difficult, especially when you're young.Every year, over 5.5 million kids between the ages 1 to 9 move to a new home, in the United States alone.* It's scary to leave behind the home and people you love when you relocate. So we're making a photo-illustrated children's book about a dog who moves to a new city to help kids who are going through a similar experience.About the Book""Vivian the Dog Moves to Brooklyn,"" is a book about a big dog moving from Albuquerque, New Mexico to Brooklyn, New York. It's 32 pages long and will be full of beautiful photo-illustrations created by Mitch and starring Vivian, with some pretty fantastic letterings and drawings by the talented, Valerie Navarro (http://thisisval.com).In the book, Vivian is a giant dog—over 6 feet tall! She loves the wide open spaces and delicious foods of New Mexico, but most of all, she loves playing with her best friend, ""the human."" When Vivian learns she and the human are moving to New York City, aka the ""Big City,"" she gets very excited. She believes everything will be as big as she is in the ""Big City,"" and she can't wait to move!As you might guess, she's pretty disappointed upon arriving in New York City and discovering that she is still the only giant wiener dog around. Things get worse, as she quickly learns their neighborhood in Brooklyn can be a pretty cramped place, especially for a big dog like her. She barely fits in their new living room! She decides to leave the human behind and return to Albuquerque on her own. Does she make it back, or does she get lost along the way? You'll have to get the book to find out!How the Photo-Illustrations are MadeVivian is not actually 6 feet tall in real life, so there's a bit of behind-the-scenes magic that goes into each image. Making photo-illustrations is kind of like making a small movie with some big visual effects. We use some of the same techniques that VFX artists use to make people different sizes in movies like The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings—a little bit of camera trickery, and a dash of computer effects. Mitch learned many of these tricks in his past life as a VFX Artist, working on movies and commercials for TCHYA! and Spotwelders.First, we start with a sketch or storyboard of the scene. This is the initial step in getting the image out of Mitch's head and onto the page. The first sketch is usually very basic, sometimes just a few scribbles. Planning the image out on paper makes the actual shoot go much smoother.Next, Mitch makes a list of props and equipment needed to make the picture work and plans the photo shoot. Some pictures are very simple and don't need much more than Vivian and a pretty background, but some are much more complex and require other actors, props and special camera equipment and lights.Now it's time to shoot! Most of the pictures are actually a mixture of several images, called a composite. It's important to get all of the shots on the same day, with the same lighting. Otherwise, they might look and feel ""off"" to the viewer, pulling them out of the story's narrative.Last of all, we pull the images from the photo shoot together on the computer. It's always fun to watch the final image start to come together. Each picture takes a lot of time and energy to make, but it's always worth it when you see the final result.Why We are Raising Money on KickstarterMaking a photo-illustrated children's book can be very expensive. We're raising money on Kickstarter for three main reasons: to help print the first batch of books, to pay for a trip to Albuquerque to shoot the scenes set there, and to help find and pay for Vivian's K9 co-star in the book, Lulu.1. Printing costsPrinting is much cheaper when done in bulk, so we've set a goal that will help us print a modest, first run of books. Each book is 32 pages long and is hardcover with a beautiful dust-jacket. If we raise even more money, we can upgrade to a premium printer like Hemlock Press, the company that prints books and magazines for The Great Discontent and Kinfolk!2. Trip to Albuquerque to shoot on locationUnlike a traditionally illustrated book, each item in a photo-illustrated book needs to be photographed. If you want to set your book in Albuquerque, for example, you either need to build a set that looks like Albuquerque or travel there. We ran the numbers, and it's much cheaper to fly to Albuquerque and shoot with a local crew than it is to rent a space and build a set in New York, where we live.3. Finding and paying for Vivian's Co-Star, Lulu!Who is Lulu? She's only Vivian's new K9 BFF/spiritual guide! Vivian runs into Lulu, a ""normal-sized dog"" shortly after deciding to return to Albuquerque. Lulu helps Vivian find her way... or does she? Again, you'll have to get the book to find out!If you know a pup that you think would be the perfect Lulu, tag them on Instagram with the hashtag: #VivianNeedsLulu or emailing us: findlulu@vivianthedog.com. We'll be checking! Bonus points if they live in New York and they share our project!TimelineWe've finished the story and initial manuscript, done some test shoots, and begun meeting with children's book editors, but there is still a lot to do before printing the book. Here's our project timeline:June 2016: Kickstarter campaign July 2016: Finalize story and shooting manuscript with the editor August - September 2016: Shoot New York/Brooklyn scenes October 2016: Shoot Albuquerque scenes November - December 2016: Post-production on the images, begin layout, Valerie Navarro's letterings and drawings are added January 2017: Final reviews with the editor, and reshoots if neededFebruary 2017: Layout is finalized, files sent to the printer March 2017: Review and finalize proofs from the printer, assemble rewards packages and prepare for shipment April 2017: Ship books and other rewards!This book is a passion project, and Mitch works full-time as a photographer and director (He also doodles a bit! You may have seen some of his images on Broad City's Instagram, or Radiolab's new podcast). This timeline provides enough breathing room to work our day jobs, finish the book, and deliver the rewards to you on time.RewardsWe have a bunch of cool rewards for our backers. Every little bit helps, and we can't say thank you enough for backing our project, but we'll try! Here are a few of our favorite rewards: ""Vivian the Dog"" tote by our friends at Totally Good Time  Check out all of the rewards in the rewards panel, and thank you again for backing the project!!Our StoryMitch and Vivian have been together since birth—Vivian's birth, that is. Mitch's sister's dog had puppies and Vivian was one of them. They've been having adventures together ever since. You can follow them on Instagram and Facebook. Mitch Boyer is the author and photo-illustrator behind ""Vivian the Dog Moves to Brooklyn."" He came up with the idea after making a series of photos showcasing Vivian's ""true size,"" like many dachshunds she thinks she's much bigger than she actually is. In addition to being a writer and photographer, Mitch works as director and illustrator. His career highlight was when Charlize Theron looked him in the eye and said, ""You're in my light."" He's done work for Saturday Night Live, Lady Gaga, New York Public Radio, and more. You can see his work at mitchboyer.com.Valerie Navarro can make pretty much anything and works as a creative producer, visual artist, and assistant food stylist. She and Mitch worked together as creative partners at their last job and have continued collaborating ever since. Val's creating the lettering and doodle illustrations for the book. She loves puppies and food videos, and her acai bowls are to die for. You can see some of her work at thisisval.com.Vivian is the greatest dachshund that ever lived (by her own estimation). She has two great loves in life: food and food. She's much smaller than she appears in the book—but her personality is giant. She loves long walks and even longer naps. If you want more Vivian in your life, you can follow her on Instagram: @iamvivianthedog.

We have gathered an incredible support network of experienced creators including children's book authors and editors who are helping to guide us as we make our first book together. We've checked and double-checked our budget, and padded our timeline to make sure that we can deliver what we promise to our backers. We couldn't do it without you!"
Darkghost Assignments: The Book Brothers|failed|My BudgetI'm trying to publish my first book.  What I plan to do with the money I raise is to get the book copyrighted, ISBN number assignment, edited, printed, and registered with booksellers throughout the USA.  I plan to self publish through a self publishing company name Tate Publishing.  Tate Publishing is charging $1500 to do all of the above plus market.  There's a 5% fee from Kickstater.  If there's any money raised after I reach 100% that money will go to shipping my rewards before the estimated time and any unforeseen book costs.Once my project is fully funded there may be some delays in the rewards to everyone because of how long it will take to publish my book. Editing and printing the book is time consuming and I will have to go to the printing press to make sure my book is being printed with the right fonts..  New ideas might slow down that processs as well. I also have to wait for the books to be shipped to me so that I can sign them for your reward and then I have to take in account how fast I can have the books mailed out.  This may take longer than expected. These are some of the risks I take in self publishing.  One thing is for sure you can count on me to work hard and diligently to complete this project and give you your rewards.
This Mick's Life|successful|"""The Mick"" is an Irishman named Christopher who got started in crime early in Dublin, Ireland. A case could be made that sexual abuse by Catholic priests or his IRA family connections contributed to his path. But he'd admit it all came down to rebellion and love of drugs and alcohol.Christopher did time in juvenile detention, Wexford Jail, and Mountjoy Prison (AKA 'The Joy') by the time he was 30. He befriended Dublin's leading criminal figures including some of the Dunne Family and ""King Scum"" Tony Felloni, who was instrumental in bringing heroin into Dublin in the 1970s. Christopher's criminal activities grew to be a full-time job when he became addicted to heroin. His addiction got so bad that he and his girlfriend decided to trade heroin for cocaine. They came to Bogota with the intention of muling 4 kilos back to Ireland.They were caught by Colombian police at El Dorado airport. Christopher served 3 years in Colombia's largest prison, La Modelo, where he befriended M-19 guerrilla insurgents, infamous cocaine cartel assassins 'Los Priscos', and the more rank-and-file of Colombia's underworld - mafiosos, thieves, conmen, killers, and more.He was released in 1989 and, having relinquished his passport, has been stranded in Colombia ever since. He traded his previous heroin addiction for debilitating alcoholism on the streets of Bogota at a time when TIME Magazine called it the world's worst city, the capital of the world's most dangerous country.Prison rape, riots, murder, torture, bank robberies, scams, hardcore partying, addiction, hedonism, and a life of crime. It's Basketball Diaries meets Marching Powder in Dublin, Ireland and Bogota, Colombia. Everything above and more is part of his story. I have already recorded hours of intensive interviews on Christopher's entire life. All I need to make his amazing life story a book is the time off work.I'm asking for $4,399 to deliver this book in exactly 60 days from when it's funded. Be a part of the effort to make This Mick's Life a reality!The only risk this project faces is NOT BEING FUNDED. If the community raises $4,399 so I can support my family for two months, I WILL DELIVER This Mick's Life in 60 days. Donate now!"

Nice Set of Shells~~ Handmade Seashell Jewelry|failed|Following our mermaid dreams, we decided that we should always be covered in seashells. But we want to take that thought a step or maybe a few further... we want to travel coast to coast to find the best shells from the best beaches. These little treasures will then be made into jewelry available to purchase through our website, www.nicesetofshells.com.  Abby in her own Nice Set of Shells Coming all the way from Jupiter, Florida, we've made it to the beaches of  North and South Carolina. We've been traveling to make it to craft shows, but the real dream is to be slinging shells, left and right, for everyone to have their own Nice Set of Shells. May all the beach lovers be adorned!Coral Cove, Florida. 2016 With the beach practically being our home, it was easy for us to see that it needs some help; whether it be picking up beach goers' trash or protecting newly hatched sea turtles in sand dunes. So we became members of the Surfrider Foundation, and have been trying to keep them in mind while traveling further and further from home. Any way we can, we're trying to help them preserve our coasts. Folly Beach, South Carolina. 2015 Going to markets and festivals throughout the south east helps us spread awareness for what Surfrider is doing for our environment. We're trying to spread the word, while scattering our shells to anyone and everyone. 你需要支援 HTML5 的瀏覽器才能查看此內容。播放打開聲音重新播放帶聲音播放00:0000:00 We really try to make sure we stay true to our environment and keep everything simple and natural. We use all natural hemp for all jewelry, that is handcrafted into necklaces, bracelets, earrings, etc. Jewelry is coated in surf wax when finished. We just recently started to craft different earth friendly products to help raise funds for our traveling, like therapeutic essential oil candles made with all natural soy. But more is to come...Bracelets made with all natural hemp and seashells.All jewelry is coated in Surf Wax for comfort and durability.   underwater themed gift baggies! what the shell?! Hannah in her Shell Candy Choker!   Having just moved away from our lives basically, it gets hard to fully trust making money through markets. I think that has to be the biggest struggle for us, overcoming the internal struggle of will this work?! We quit our jobs to make seashell jewelry for all beach lovers, so that's pretty much the biggest risk. We've gone out on a limb, so to speak, so we're just gonna keep shelling away!
Shattered & Restored|failed|Restoring the Heart Ministries is bringing awareness and healing to the victims of the most evil criminal industries in the world – Human Sex Trafficking. Over the past year alone, local, national and global headlines have featured children, teens and adults that have become the victims of the most disturbing crimes against humanity, Human Sex Trafficking.  These victims are both males and females from every state, country, ethnicity and social status.  Individuals who have been coerced, forced, or manipulated into this industry are merely, objects of selfish profitable gain, with no regard for one’s life, safety, security nor basic human needs. They are being rescued, but then returning into that world because there is nothing to break to chain. That is what we want to create!From kidnapping to families willingly selling their children, from agricultural industries to local restaurants, Human Trafficking is aggressively taking hold of our global society.  Human Sex Trafficking is not only happening on foreign soil; it is happening in our own country!  America ranks #3 in countries identified as part of this horrifying industry.If, by some miracle, these victims are freed from their personal living hell on earth, they will continue to mentally relive the trauma that was inflicted upon them over and over again. The chance of them integrating into a normal life is next to impossible without professional help. Julie Woodley is the Founder and Director of Restoring the Heart Ministries, a public speaker and author, certified trauma counselor, and also holds an M.A. in Mental health counseling.  Julie is also a survivor of Human Trafficking, which began at the age of 6.  Julie’s first-hand trauma experiences have made her so passionate for these forgotten men, women and children.  Through Julie Woodley, Restoring the Heart Ministries has already broken the silence and brought healing to those who have experienced Post Abortion Trauma and Sexual Abuse through their video series “Into My Arms” and “In the Wildflowers”.  Now, Restoring the Heart Ministries would like to break the silence and bring healing to those who have been traumatized through Human Trafficking.Through Julie Woodley, Restoring the Heart Ministries wants to create a unique Video Curriculum Series that will specifically help heal the scars of Human Trafficking trauma.  This project will help survivors cope with their trauma, and allow God’s healing of the torment they experienced.The ministries that rescue these kids, and the counselors that work in the safe homes, have asked Julie to create a teaching tool that could bring hope and healing to these precious ones.  They're in need of something in a Video format (for those who can’t read) that could also be adapted for different cultures & languages. Julie is working with award-winning producer David Nixon from DNP Studios (Facing the Giants & Fireproof) to bring this production to fruition.The goal is to bring restoration through visual storytelling by showing them a bright future through God's healing. This curriculum will impact the world with the voices of the top trauma experts and theologians in the country. Those who have been trafficked deserve the very best, a masterpiece filled with love and the beauty of God. Please consider supporting Restoring the Heart Ministries film project, Shattered and Restored, through prayer and financial giving. Creating films for healing of such atrocities is risky business. Most people are aware of human trafficking but don’t know how to help.  Our greatest prayer is to bring the healing presence of God into the deep wounds of the broken that have experienced the devastation of sexual trafficking. We feel the key to success is to work with other great ministries that are also committed to those that have been in the battlefields with the wounded. We want to prayerfully come alongside those that are continuing to help the victims of sexual trafficking and work with them in order to bring the healing presence of God into the holy work of restoration.The main challenge is to raise enough money to complete Restoring the Heart Ministries new project, “Shattered and Restored”.  We have now taped the voice of our first woman that was trafficked as a little girl (Tina).  Our hope is to complete her courageous work by transforming her incredible story into film as soon as possible. To complete her story, we need another $14,000.  Once our film project is complete, Restoring the Heart Ministries intends to bring awareness, hope and God’s word to those who are deeply wounded and traumatized by sexual trafficking.  Many have already received healing from childhood sexual abuse and post abortion trauma through Restoring the Heart Ministries work with individuals and groups nationally and is currently working on translating these projects into Spanish to expand God’s work globally.  Restoring the Heart Ministries also intends to utilize “Shattered and Restored” with individuals and groups.  But to bring this amazing project to completion, we need your help by prayerfully giving your financial support to Restoring the Heart Ministries.  Now you can take a stand against Human Trafficking by financially supporting this project, knowing your contribution will help many of these survivors!
Barry County Milk|failed|Are you tired of paying nearly $5 for a gallon of milk in the stores only to realize the flavor is extremely inconsistent. Well as a farmer I'm tired of hearing about how expensive it is and how the flavor is being destroyed by new pasteurization processes. Our goal is to bring back old fashioned processing allowing us to provide you, the consumer, a superior product.  UPDATE:  9/2/14. We are progressing on the marketing front which is fantastic for this start up venture. I believe we are well on our way to our initial goal of marketing 3000 gallons of milk per day. Here's a little more complex detail as to how our operation is going to be different then all the milk your local grocer offers. Big processing plants such as Hiland now use a HTST pasteurizer. If you're not familiar with this it works kind of like an old fashioned heat radiator. The milk is pumped thru a system of pipes heated at extreme temperatures where it only takes like 15 seconds to burn out the bacteria. Unfortunately burning is exactly what it does to the milk. We are going to go back and use an old fashioned batch pasteurizer. We won't be nearly as efficient but our flavor will be natural and consistent. Not only can you taste the difference but you can actually see the difference.  As a dairy farmer its a shame to me to see the kind of dairy product that's offered to you the consumer in the store. We also have a second advantage that will set our quality way ahead of what's available now. We produce high quality milk on our farm that translates to a much better product for you. See what you aren't aware is that yes there are current milk standards but the way they work is really quite sad. A truck can come pick up your high quality milk and then mix it with four farms who produce a very low quality milk and it can still pass to be processed for you to drink. Well with our own processing I can control exactly how good that milk will be from start to finish. Our milk is such a good quality that we actually drink it raw with absolutely no issues. We are going to offer one more thing thats not available in the stores, non homogenized whole milk. You want to make your own cream, butter, or maybe even a little cheese. This will be the product for you. Maybe you just want a little fresh cream on your cereal or in your coffee, with our non homogenized whole milk the cream will still separate allowing you to scoop it right off the top and enjoy it. I'm sure I'm still forgetting things. If there's something you would like to know don't hesitate to ask. I'm knew to this so there's a lot a make not think of as relevant that you may like to know. As with every new business we are facing some very big risks. The equipment to get started in extremely expensive yet that's the least complex challenge.  Our biggest challenge is the political red tape that is better known as corporate america.  The dairy world is ruled by just a few big corporations and they pull all the puppet strings.   Even still I'm extremely optimistic that our product will market itself once we get the wheels turning.

Surf Right - A Documentary Inspired by Cold Water Surfers|failed|IntroductionIn the frigid grey winter mornings, when the sun can’t begin to warm the rocky coastline of the Northeast, a community of die-hards paddle into the crushing cold to ride whatever waves they can find. This passion for surfing lives on in the frosty air so far removed from the waters of Southern California and Hawaii. Bikinis and palm trees are thousands of miles away. Surf Right is a documentary film project dedicated to celebrating these hardy individuals who brave crazy temperatures to follow their passion. We look forward to sharing the film, our experiences along the way and some amazing rewards we’ve designed specifically to continue the story.RewardsWe’ve created some great rewards that have been inspired by the story.  Here are some of the highlights (for a closer look at all of the rewards including the Women's styles click here) :Who’s Behind the ProjectSurf Right began as a passion project for us (Michael Schaeffer and Marcus Wilson) in early 2012.  As we've become consumed by the passion, dedication and utter disregard for the status quo displayed by so many cold water surfers, we connected with John Huet, Eran Lobel, Mark Hankey and our friends at Element to help us tell a truly powerful story.We’ve combined our expertise to share Surf Right in a complete and comprehensive way.  We are not only planning to tell a story through film, but also continuing the experience with backer rewards that have been inspired by the incredible people, weather and waves of cold water surfing. A team of creative and passionate story tellers with diverse backgrounds, the experience of the collective group behind the Surf Right Project includes: A combined experience in film production of over 50 yearsEmmy award winning producersPhotographing some of the world’s most celebrated athletes, including Tiger Woods, Tom Brady, Lebron James, Kobe Bryant, A Rod, Serena Williams, Michael Phelps, and Michael JordanLeading creative teams at major brands like Reebok, Bose and PumaLeading successful startups and fostering entrepreneurship at MITOur team is fully committed to sharing an amazing project and thoughtful rewards.Why We’re Doing itWhen we first started working on Surf Right, we were drawn to the project by the passion, grit and determination so clearly demonstrated by cold water surfers.Since the beginning we've focused on telling the stories as they are lived by people who applaud the courageous and attempt the downright crazy.  These people push forward, go blindly, test limits and take pride in what they do.  For them, there is no other way. It’s just right.We want to celebrate this mentality.Behind the Scenes LookHere are a few glimpses from behind the scenes:Frost bite and sharks.(Aside from those minor things, this project has very little risk. If we hit our funding goals, backers will get some pretty exciting rewards and experiences.  The collective Surf Right team has been creating awesome products and producing compelling films for years.)

We plan to keep doing this each and every year!Thank you all so much in advance and hope to see you at the show this year!facebook.com/talegaholidayyoutube.com/talegaholidayThere are many challenges of the show each and every year. I think promotion is definitely the hardest. Trying to get as many people to come see the show is pretty difficult. Word seems to spread by itself. Another challenge is troubleshooting the problems of some faulty equipment. With this project it will help get rid of some of the faulty equipment. With every project there are risks and challenges that is one of the biggest reasons why I do the show each and every year, to keep learning.
Help me publish my picture (kids) books!|successful|"This is basically a reiteration of the video but as I writer I understand reading something over watching it.  Anyway, if you don't know me already my name is Peter Helm, I'm 23 years old.  I am a philanthropist, artist and writer and I want to write kids books for a living.  Ever since I was young my big dream was to write meaningful picture books that would be able to positively impact children and adults alike.  With that dream in mind and the encouragement of friends, family and teachers alike I've created two kids books I am really proud of and want to share with the world!And after many revisions, getting my BFA, and paying off school I finally feel like the books are complete and I am ready to publish them!  Unfortunately, publishers right now don't feel the same.  The reason comes down to is there aren't any willing to take chances with new picture book writers right now. There hasn't been that many successful picture books recently so justifiably publishers aren't looking for anyone.  They're not looking period.  ""It's not you- it's me"" attitude.  But I've never been one to give up just because someone tells me so (in this case at least 15 times).  I have good stories that I want to share with the world and I'm not going to give up!  I know they'll do well and I am determined to make it happen.  And with your help I hope I can afford to.  So without further ramblings I should introduce the very thing I'm working at:  The books. The first is the Lonely Lonely Chameleon.  The story -without spoiling too much- is about a chameleon who lives in a forest with all sorts of animals that don't look anything like it and so they all avoid it leaving the Lonely Lonely Chameleon sad and-well lonely  But The Lonely Lonely Chameleon is not without any friends, it has one- The Dear Dear Turtle who loves it despite its odd odd shapes.  Unfortunately the Dear Dear Turtle is so popular among all the other animals that it often doesn't have enough time to play with the Lonely Lonely Chameleon. With that the Lonely Lonely Chameleon goes off on a quest to find a place that it can home and venture on a perilous journey to discover what true friendship is about, understanding who you are and caring for others for who they are.  The book has a lot of double word play (ie Lonely Lonely Chameleon, Dear Dear Turtle etc), and few tongue twisters and silly phrases here and there that I think both adults and children alike can enjoy.  The drawings are a contrast of straight lines right next to natural lines going with theme of the book and the coloring was done with the same themes in mind and I don't want to get too into it so as to take away from the storyline but my point is is that all of the book is done intentionally to create a story that I think many would enjoy.The second book is Sometimes Life Can Be Scary which shifts gears toward a little more serious of a subject that I feel isn't touched on very often with picture books and that is: Being sad and scared.  And that is what this book confronts: dealing with those scared and sad feelings and knowing what to do with them.  Because I think that children should know that life can be scary at times.  I also think sadly a lot of children know that far more than they should and they need a book that understands the pain that comes along with that and more importantly tells you are special, you are wonderful and life is worth fighting for because life can also be great!  This book is completely different from The Lonely Lonely Chameleon in both art style and message and I think that's appropriate considering that the subject matter is completely different.  Sometimes Life Can Be Scary has a rhyme scheme throughout the entire books.    I wrote this book at the time for someone very dear to me to help them with their struggles and I want share this book with the world now for everyone that is going through rough times, has gone through rough times or will go through rough times and know there is light at the end of the tunnel!And now that I have given you what the books are I want to tell you what I will do to make this vision a reality.  1. I want to get these books cataloged with ISBN #'s.  That way they are official books that can be universally looked up 2. Once given numbers, I will publish them online electronically via ebooks, kindle, nook and whatever other means I can distributing it to as many places as I can justify. I would love to go physical format but I think starting here will be best (And with the profit of the books online I will pursue hard covers). 3. I will market the books with reviewers, ads, blogs and things of that matter to get them noticed and seen by many.  Ultimately people have to know about the books to buy them.4. Reward those who helped me make my dream a reality.  I will email everyone who donated an electronic copy of the book via whichever option is most accessible to the donor and whatever else I promised to go with it based on the amount donated.5. I will move forward and keep making kids books, maybe even make these animated books so people can watch them.  Maybe even sell them in physical book form so people can buy them at bookstores.  But it has to start here, and I know will eventually get to there with your help.  So with that I apologize for being long winded, and I thank you for your time and whatever you can allocate will be appreciated and used wisely for the pursuit of my dream and ultimately for good use.  Thank you.PS - If you're interested in any of my other artwork I have an etsy website located here:http://www.etsy.com/shop/RefinedGraffitiArtPSS- OCRemix.org is the community from where I was permitted to use the music in the video.  If you liked it or have interest in videogame remixed music it is a wonderful site with a lot of cool music and people that I would suggest stopping at.  Also they too have a kickstarter project going on so if you're interested in that here is their link. http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ocremix/a-4-disc-final-fantasy-6-album-from-oc-remix"
Moon's Eye View - Save The World|failed|"Howdy folks!!! I'm trying to raise $5000 to fund the documentary part of my movie.The documentary part of my movie involves me driving around the good ol' U.S.ofA. getting video footage of important landmarks and telling the story of us good ol' Earthlings.Please read the details below and if this project seems like something you would like to invest in, read the ""backer rewards"" part on the right and determine the best tier of pledging for you. Every little bit counts and if I don't reach the $5000 by the 1st of July (which is coming up really quick), then you will not be charged at all.This is a fun way of making someone's artistic dream come to life and if you donate to the cause, you get really cool stuff in return.(Here's a little synopsis of the movie)When science fiction collides with non fiction, a tale of romance and adventure is born.Located inside the Moon is a lounge that hosts a show about Earth called, Moon's Eye View. The Moon people have been secretly observing the planet for millions of years, watching the humans grow and evolve. Whenever the humans make a positive accomplishment that improves the world, the Moon people discuss it on the show live and broadcast it to the Universe.Unfortunately, there is not much to discuss anymore and the show is losing it's popularity. Although the humans continue to make great accomplishments with their technologies, the social, political and environmental situation on Earth to name a few, have reached the highest level of disorder. The world has become a big mess and no one wants to clean it up.Fortunately, one of the Earth Watch Camera Operators, Zen, sets out to get the story that could not only save the show, but could save the planet as well. He does what no other fictional being has ever considered doing and he travels through the Fiction/Non Fiction porthole to Earth and begins his mission while the Universe watches live.This project is a mixed-media movie. It’s part documentary, part narrative movie, part presentation (like the TED Talks) and of course there are a few sequences in the movie that involve computer graphics and after effects.In the past four years I have studied the works, ideas, innovations, actions and philosophies of many people from present day all the way back to ancient times, all doing their part to improve the world (some of my resources are listed below).Throughout these studies I have created a really unique way for the world to get on a path of improvement and the only way for me to describe this process would be in the form of a narrative movie. And a powerpoint presentation. And a documentary.If you like unique stories with fun characters told in an original way outside the Hollywood box, then this movie is for you. It's a really fun concept and I'm very fortunate to have the opportunity to make it happen this summer.The goal is for it to premiere at the theater I work at live via webcast on Saturday, September 29th and Sunday the 30th.If you are concerned about the environment, social issues, political issues, global economics and anything that has to do with the world we live in, then this movie is for you!I'm giddy with excitement to have the opportunity to make this movie, and I'm also excited to share my ideas for a better world as well.I wrote most of it for a small budget and short production time but as with all movies, there needs to be some kind of cash involved.I broke the funding down into three separate parts, The Documentary part being the first one. This part requires me to get video footage of over 30 different places from around the country that are crucial to the visual part of the documentary. From solar farms, wind farms and nuclear power plants to sustainable architecture, Hoover Dam,  and so much more.For originality purposes I will not use stock footage. Besides, it will make the movie so much better if I shoot this stuff myself :)I have located all these ‘sites’ around the U.S. and planned a circular drive around the country to get them on video. Here is a link to the map. http://goo.gl/maps/IBuKHere are the requirements to make it happen...A Rental Van and fuel - Estimated $3500A Camera - Estimated $500Misc. Expenses - Estimated $500Just In Case - $500Grand Total = $5000The trip will begin on July 3rd and I’ll return to beautiful Lansing Michigan on the 19th. It doesn’t give me much time but I’ll have to be back to work at the movie theater on the 20th for the Batman premiere, they need me there and I don’t want to lose my job that I love so much :)When I return I will immediately begin my next funding segment on Kickstarter, The Narrative part which will be shot in August and then the funding for the Live Presentation part will begin around the 1st of September.Of course my infinite amounts of gratitude will be shared with backers and I would like to make a promise to you, if you are as psyched about this project as much as I am, and you donate to the cause, I promise you that the money will be spent very wisely, frugally and only on necessary means for the movie. And all money that is left over from this first funding part will be put towards the next one and so on. Thank you :)Please read over my backer rewards and find the one that best fits your budget and remember, you are not only funding a movie project, you are helping the world become a better place which in turn would improve your very own lives. Thank you again :)Here is an incomplete list of my resources so that you know I’m not just fantasizing about improving the world. Some of these resources may seem a bit hokey to you, but I can assure you that each one has at least one valuable piece of information that contributes to the grand scheme of the project. They include information about environment and sustainability solutions, economic solutions, energy solutions, individual inner peace and well being, technologies, filmmaking, writing, spirituality from many perspectives and beliefs, success etc...These resources are just some of the books...Natural Capitalism - Paul Hawken, Amory B.

ClearyFor my filmmaking experience, the first movie I made was 77 minutes long and was completely experimental to learn as many lessons in filmmaking as possible. It's called Big Sushi and it also has many philosophies about Earth improvement and just plain surreal entertainment. Countless lessons in film were learned making that movie.Also, even though I never intended to be an actor, I was the lead role in a movie a friend of made for his church. It was a wonderful experience and again, countless lessons were learned.We also shot a short called, Graffiti Motel and that taught me a lot about after effects. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsLILIC9G-IThere are a few other projects I've done that gave me much experience in filmmaking but the afore mentioned were the most educational for me.Thanks again and be excited. This is a wonderful project. Take care!~Tucker"

Geek Seekers|successful|"Geek SeekersA Web Series About Geeking the UnknownIf the truth is out there, who betterto find it than a couple of geeks? Geek Seekers International searched farand wide, interviewing thousands of applicants* before deciding thatthe two perfect candidates were well-known geeks Jen Page and MonteCook. These two geeks--some might say uber-geeks--have the knowledge,the skills, and the necessary lack of sense to track down the truthabout the mysteries of our world. No danger is too great. No mysterytoo deep. No haunted house too scary** for the…GEEK SEEKERS!Geek Seekers is a web series aboutgeeks and the paranormal--two great tastes that taste great together,we think. In each episode two geeks will investigate some strangelocation or phenomena. Ghosts, UFOs, bigfoot… these are the kindsof things the Geek Seekers will investigate. In the geekiest waypossible. In Geek Seekers, you'll see a mixture of realinvestigations, geekly discussions, and the occasional bit ofsilliness, just for good measure.What will the Geek Seekers find? Ghosts? Ogopogo? Aliens? What craziness will they instigate on their own? What trouble will they find themselves in as they do this crazy stuff?And the most important question of all: do you want to watchthem do all that?*Notreally.**Well,maybe. I mean, there might be some screaming. And running. Expectsome running.What Is This Project?Geek Seekers is a web series starringus, Jen Page and Monte Cook. We're a couple of geeks, fascinated bythe paranormal and the mysterious. One day, while talking about ourshared love of all things weird and unexplained, we decided toinvestigate some of the most intriguing mysteries first hand. And wewanted to start big. So we figured, let's try to find Area 51. That'sright. Eventually, we're going all the way to the unknown reaches of the Nevadadesert looking for UFOs, secret government bases, and anything elseinteresting to a couple of geeks--and we're going to film it. But first we're going to hunt for ghosts, bigfoot, and other fun paranormal stuff. Now,we'll be honest with you. Knowing us, there's going to be somesilliness, and more than a little geekery. We might spend our downtime chatting about movies, gaming, and things like that. That'sgoing to be a part of the series too. But the investigation is forreal. We are serious about wanting to really do what we can touncover various mysteries. That's why it's a series. There's just so muchto explore! We may be geeks who like to joke around, but wouldn't itbe amazing if we also actually get some evidence of something forreal? On film? For everyone to watch?Who Are You Guys?Jen Page: An actor, afilmmaker, and a model, Jen has already cemented herself in the geekworld. Her recent acting projects allowed her to become a rebelliousalien, a crafty sorceress rogue and a vampire (twice). As achild, though, Jen dreamed of being even more than that. Jen’s wildimagination convinced her she could be a superhero when she grew up.Or perhaps a cowboy gypsy scientist ghost hunter. All her life peopletold her that she wasn't being realistic, but she ignoredthem.Finally, she met someone that agreed with her. After talkingto Monte, Jen realized that she could ghost hunt, fight Bigfoot, readpalms and wear some kick ass goggles; all while talking geekery withher genre-appropriate co-host.Monte Cook: Monteis that D&D guy. He's never had a real job. For most of his adultlife, he's stayed at home writing novels, game books, articles, andshort stories. He designed Heroclix, co-wrote 3rd Edition D&D, and is working on some new D&D thing.He even wrote a book about conspiracy theories, aliens, and kookystuff like that. It never occurred to him until he met Jen that hecould actually go out and investigate UFOs, ghosts, and  theparanormal first hand. Even better, she added, ""and when we do,let's film it!""Now action-oriented Monte has a new rule. Henever does anything that he can't justify to his 16-year-old selfshould he ever travel back in time. When reached for commentregarding Geek Seekers, 16-year old Monte said, ""Sounds cool.Can we talk about movies, games, and other geeky stuff on the way tothe investigations?"" Yes, 16-year old Monte, yes we can.What is theFunding For?Gear. Obviously, we needcameras, decent lights, and things like that. We'd also really liketo get some specialized equipment. For what we want to do,we need EMF detectors, motion sensitive cameras, and other coolgeekery. We're serious about this. Unfortunately, that stuff isexpensive.Travel expenses. We need to travel to various plannedinvestigation sites. We're discussing going down toCalifornia and to various locations around the Pacific Northwest, and perhaps even up to Canada.And probably some No-Doz, because theUFOs and ghosts are best seen at late at night.Maybe a couple of sandwiches? A bag ofchips? Some kind of junk food for the trip. We are geeks, after all.Our Mountain Dew budget is astronomical.What Will the Finished Series BeLike?If the project gets fully funded, weaim to do an estimated season of six episodes, each between 7 and 15minutes long.Some investigations might carry overinto multiple episodes, while others might be self-contained. Much of this is still up in the air. The money we're asking for will mostly just get us started with those first few episodes. If we go beyond that (or have a second campaign later), we'll be able to do more episodes and eventually even get to Area 51.When we conduct an investigation, we'lldo our homework. In each episode, we'll provide thebackground--hopefully in an entertaining way--so you know what we'relooking for. Each episode will involve us doing all that we can toget to the truth behind the stories we've been told.  Of course, in investigations like this,there's a lot of downtime, waiting for something to happen. But thething about us is that we're just like you. We love to joke around,and talk about geekly stuff. Want to know what Monte really thinksabout your favorite rpg? What Jen's favorite action movie is, andwhy? You'll probably find that out and a lot more if you watch.First and foremost, though, we'll bethere to actually find some evidence. Each investigation will be anadventure with each own challenges and goals. And there will besurprises and fun things. Best of all, through our website, you'll beable to provide feedback and share your own ideas for investigations,your own experiences involving the paranormal, and your own views onthe geeky stuff we talk about.This is all a new undertaking for eachof us, but when you think about it, it makes sense. You know us forour geeky accomplishment, and what on Earth is geekier than this? Wethank you in advance for your contributions and support. You guys arethe best."
Quern - Undying Thoughts|successful|                          Quern is a first person puzzle adventure with captivating story and beautiful graphics. The game is currently in early development by Zadbox Entertainment. Quern refreshes the genre with flexible gameplay and reuseable puzzle mechanics. The visuals and the music combine traditional and modern elements providing a unique mood for the game.“Quern is but a little fragment of the World Chain, but it has quite an important role. Civilisations rise and fall due to this world.“As huge fans of story-driven games and detailed narratives, we wrote and sketched the concepts of a complex and coherent world. The works of Jules Verne in particular, influenced us greatly. Our aim was to capture the mood and essence of his novels and combine that with magical, fantasy elements.This universe is a structured system of worlds all connected to each other. The player assumes the role of a person, who has been trapped in one of these worlds which is a mysterious island surrounded by oceans as far as the eye could see. He finds himself in front of an entrance to a deserted ancient city.The player recieves guidance from two different sources, which are both mysterious in completely different ways. One of them is a scientist, who talks to the player through letters, which are factual, rational - written with a logical approach. The other one is an ancient spirit, who makes connection with us through visions, and gives us guidance about the spirituality of the island.The player soon finds out that these two guides have conflicting opinions about the island’s mysteries. They both demand us to understand Quern, but while the professor wants us to experiment with the environment and manipulate it, the spirit asks us to observe and be a part of it, without physically changing anything. The letters we find contain direct instructions and answers, whereas the visions raise questions, so we find out the answers ourselves. It is up to the player to decide which guide they want to follow, but sooner or later, they must make a permanent choice.Before we created the story of the stranger (the player), we wrote a whole backstory for the island itself. There were three heroes of an ancient civilisation who have been trapped in Quern long before the stranger has. They managed to understand how the operating principles work in this world and experienced a whole new way of existence. Their presence here made great consequences in their home world. They left behind fragments and the wisdom of their culture in many different forms. Thousands of years after the three heroes managed to leave the island, an archaeologist came in search of their legacy. He knew about the unrealistic nature of the island and he came here with a clear purpose, to understand it. The professor tamed the elements of the island and learned to use them for his own purposes, his knowledge has grown more powerful than he has ever imagined. However, unexpected events happened in Quern not long before the stranger arrived.As we delve deeper in the story, we find hints of the happenings of the past, and these aid us in understanding our role and importance in the story. WATCH THE GAMEPLAY TRAILER IN HD The gameplay follows the main elements of classic puzzle adventure games. We can pick up many different objects and store them in our inventory where we can inspect them and interact with them. These objects all have colourful and varied purposes. We run into hints and clues that we will need later on to solve riddles or complete puzzles. At first, we face smaller, easier, independent challenges, and as we progress, the game starts to get more complex and unpredictable.WHAT IS DIFFERENT?Quern is open world, meaning the players can freely explore and wander around the island. Putting an object in a slot and walking away is simply not our style. Of course we have keys opening gates, but in Quern most of the puzzle mechanics are reusable in some other way. As the story is progressing, we face more and more complicated challenges that might lead us back to an earlier puzzle, forcing us to re-imagine it with the extra items or knowledge we have gathered. This way the player needs to think about the game as a whole, not just as a series of individual puzzles. We also allow the player to mess with the game mechanics by not stopping them when the interaction is incorrect. The player has the chance to experience other outcomes which sometimes seem to be completely pointless. These results help the players find out how to get to the solution.THE MAP SYSTEM Looking at the map provides the player with a better understanding of the place he is currently exploring. Different zones and locations are revealed on the map as the player wanders around the island.CONTROLSDespite believing that FPS controls give the player the perfect freedom, we are working on another option for people who are more familiar with the classic, mouse-only controls.To make the game more immersive we wanted the players to be themselves instead of playing a role. One of our main concepts was to give no information about the look or the backstory of the main character. This way people can easily connect with the stranger regardless of age, gender or ethnicity.As great fans of the MYST series, the visual style of these fantastic games have been our biggest influences. We aimed for a surreal mood to make the player curious as to what the rules of this world are, and urge them into diving deeper and deeper into its secrets. To further the surrealism, we designed Quern to be a world full of contrast, yet still maintaining aspects of realism. We have a warm, sandy island in the middle of an endless ocean covered with pine trees, which are originally native to mountains. The sky is full of rain clouds but it never rains, so the ground is dry and cracked. The buildings are clearly ancient with relatively modern, mechanic additions. As the puzzles get more challenging, completing them becomes even more visual and directly rewarding in addition to the progression made in the game. Though the island itself is highly detailed and well processed, the menu and interface design is elegant and minimalist, which fits well with the realistic graphics.When we started the development, we worked with the free version of Unity 4, but we recently transitioned to the brand new and more efficient Unity 5. This change gives our artist a new level of freedom to further improve Quern's graphics.We are working on the English texts and voice over for now, but we plan to translate the game to at least three other languages: German, Spanish and Hungarian.For now, we are developing the game for Windows, Mac and Linux but we hope to be able to reach PlayStation and Xbox consoles as well.We are already testing Oculus Rift with satisfying results and we are eager to work with it, and make Quern a more believable experience.The game in it’s current state works perfectly with 4:3, 16:9 and 21:9 aspect ratios and we are working on interface optimization for 4k to make it ready for future standards.We all knew each other before we started working as a video game development team. We were a group of friends with completely different professions and interests, but one thing we all had in common, was our love for games. Soon we realised that our differences complement each other, and we started working together on a test project years before Quern. It started out merely as a hobby but we turned out to be an efficient team and we all really enjoyed working together. At the time we were all university students and we had no time to finish the project. HOW DID QUERN START?Quern was originally a 3D artwork for our designer, Daniel’s dissertation. It was basically a non-interactive environment design demonstration for his thesis. People’s reactions to the project were far better than expected and they wanted to explore this yet unfinished world themselves. After getting his degree, Daniel started thinking about developing a game with the already created and beloved style and mood. Years have passed since the test project and we came together as a team again to create something bigger than any of us has ever done before.WHAT IS ZADBOX?Working on video games is our dream, and we are eager to do this as a full time job. After we finish Quern, we would like to continue working together on other video games and media related projects as an official studio. For this reason we founded a company called Zadbox Entertainment.   The game has many different areas with their own individual moods and atmospheres. We wanted each zone to have its own unique music while still keeping the soundtrack consistent. One of the challenges was to find the right ambience for each area and to build interesting soundscapes around key scenes in the game. The music is an important factor in making the gameplay even more immersive, by having it react to interactions made by the player. The soundtrack of Quern works well on its own but we had to make sure it also works as background music. It’s very atmospheric with a combination of textural sounds and traditional instruments with the addition of unique musical elements for each scene.        .soundcloud .card {          max-height: 250px;        }        .soundcloud .embedly-card iframe.embedly-card {          height: 220px;        }        .card iframe[title~=SoundCloud] {          height: unset;        }      As indie game developers we don’t have a publisher to cover the expenses that come with creating a video game. This is our first major game and we would like to get feedback from as many sources as possible. Kickstarter is the best way to achieve this. Supporting us here gives us immediate feedback about the possible success of the game.Our biggest hope is to get enough support to fund the game so we can dedicate all of our time to the project.The money goal we set would allow us to create Quern the way we imagined it.WHERE WILL THE MONEY GO?We dedicated most of our free time throughout the last year for the development of the game. We need your support so we can focus on Quern above anything else and invest all of our time and energy into the game. We already have plans we can work with although the game’s quality, length and the amount of details all depend on the money we can invest into the development. Besides that, there is a fair amount of money we would like to spend on recording the voice over. We’ve already got in contact with a brilliant voice actor, Michael Morris, who we think is the perfect match for the narration of Quern. We talked to him about the game and our vision and he supported us by recording the narration for our trailer. We knew we needed to work with him at the very moment we first heard his amazing voice.Finally there are the expenses we simply cannot avoid. Fees for the services we use, prices of the software we need to buy, renting a workplace for us, paying taxes and managing our company.Our money goal would allow us to finish Quern but we have further plans to improve the quality of the game and to give you more content.We highly appreciate any support you can give us! Here are a few perks you can choose from when deciding on backing the project. The game will be DRM FREE.To add an add-on to your pledge, go to the “manage” section on the Kickstarter page and increase your pledge by the amount your desired add-on costs. (Keep in mind you can add multiple add-ons to your pledge.) These add-ons allow you to add individual items to your rewards. To be able to purchase add-ons however, you need to pledge a certain amount first.Please pledge £10 (£8 for early birds) - ‘Digital copy of the game’ or more to get access to the following add-ons:and please pledge £40 - ‘Hard copy of the game’ or more to get access to the following add-ons:At the end of our Kickstarter campaign we will contact you to specify your add-on choices.Making a video game is something we have always wanted to do so we started working on Quern out of passion. The more time we spend on it, the more we realise creating a video game is a lot more difficult and challenging than we had imagined. There are many risks involved, some of which we can’t necessarily deal with without money.One of the biggest challenges for us as a newly founded company is that we have a very limited budget. We don’t have a portfolio in game development to show people who we are, so we can only hope that our game itself is enough to get the community’s support.And for the same reason, there is a chance that the game won’t find its audience on Steam Greenlight. This would put us in a very difficult situation, as we would have to come up with a different solution to release the game and make it commercially available.As well as having all the risks of the development itself, there could also be personal risks.There are only four of us in our group, so if anything happens to any of us, the whole development might need to shut down, until they are able to get back to work. Since all four of us are great friends, it would be impossible to find a perfect replacement for anyone in the project. Unfortunately, there is nothing we can do about personal issues, apart from taking care of ourselves.There are also technical difficulties that come with working with certain software. Ever since we started adding in puzzles and complex game mechanics, we’ve faced many different technical issues. So far we have managed to overcome all of them, but it is possible that one day we’ll find an issue that we simply can’t fix without having to hire someone with a lot more experience than we have.
"Nabil & Karim | Anise K ~ Bicentenary Album"|successful| Nabil & Karim, and Anise K are coming together to make a new, full-length album of songs (and one professionally filmed and edited music video) dedicated to the bicentennial celebration of the birth of Baha’u’llah! This unique, global music project consists of three musicians from three different countries! Nabil, from Portugal, Karim, from South Korea, and Anise from Australia. Since there is a certain magic that exists only when creative individuals with a unified vision come together in the same physical space - we will come together in August, to finalize the recording process of the album! And in early October we will come together again to film the music video! Recording, mixing, mastering, CD design/printing, and video production will be carried out by industry professionals. We will be producing and recording this album in a world class recording studio in Europe.From Nabil and Karim, you can expect some similarities to their previous two albums of Baha’i inspired songs and from Anise K, you can expect excellence in musicality, production, and his strong ability to bring cultural sounds together as one. This album will be an amalgamation and fusion of all three contributors. Nabil plays guitar, sings and produces, Karim raps, does beatboxing and produces, and Anise plays piano and produces. All three of us are hyped, excited, stoked, thrilled and humbled by the prospects of this conceptual album and music video becoming a reality! We are calling on your support to help us make this happen by doing one or all of the following steps: 1) Make a financial pledge on this page right now; 2) Tell your friends, family, and colleagues about our project; 3) Repeat steps 1 and 2!  These CDs will make for fantastic gifts, the songs will make for great conversation starters to have in your car or on your phone, and the music video will be a powerful online tool for all to share. These will be top-notch pop/hip hop/r&b sounding songs infused with Baha’i quotes, prayers and reflections. Our process as three different creative minds so far has been one of consultation, cooperation, and true expression - all with an undertone of love, respect, and understanding. We truly want to offer the best of each of our abilities to this project. With this year being so special for every Baha’i to offer unique acts of service we are inspired to offer our best in the form of music that is infused with Baha’u’llah’s Words. This is the breakdown of our costs: This is our timeline: MAY - Initial ConversationsJUNE - Planning / ConsultationsJULY - Kickstarter Campaign / Spiritual Preparation / SongwritingAUGUST - Travel / Recording / ProductionSEPTEMBER - Mixing / Mastering / PrintingOCTOBER - Digital Download Available / Professional Music Video shootNOVEMBER - CD Shipping / Reward Fulfillment All three of us thank you for taking your time to view our project, and we thank you in advance for bringing our music to the world! Respect and love, Nabil, Karim, Anise Some of our previous works: Background on Nabil & Karim: In 2009, two young men set out on a mission to create music. Music for the next generation. Music, that was directly inspired by and included the Sacred Writings of the Baha’i Faith. Since that time, these two guys (Nabil and Karim) have recorded two albums and travelled to many Baha’i communities and conferences across North America. They have visited many junior youth camps and other various community celebrations and holy day gatherings. Their first album can now be found on all major music sites...and soon their second one as well! Background on Anise K: Anise Arsalon Khoshmashrab (born February 20, 1985) is a International recording artist, record producer, and songwriter known by his stage name Anise K. His professional breakthrough occurred in 2006 when Anise moved to Los Angeles and was working alongside the Three time Grammy Award winning producer KC Porter who has worked with the likes of: Carlos Santana, Ricky Martin, Usher, Jenifer Lopez and many more...In 2012 Anise released his first single ‘Walking On Air’ through Sony Music Entertainment. The song features guest vocals from American rapper Snoop Dogg and American singer Bella Blue.The single has been a worldwide hit, topping charts in Russia, Hungary, Greece, Cyprus, Australia, Japan, Thailand, Indonesia, Bulgaria, France, Belarus and Azarbaijan. To date, it has hit #1 on the official iTunes charts in numerous countries throughout Europe & Asia.  Anise K The most major risks and challenges have already been alleviated through our consultation process in setting this project up. Any unforeseen risks or challenges that arise from this point on will be a hurdle that we will overcome together with our Kickstarter backers. (basically we will keep you in the loop of any challenges and victories, so you always know where the project is at.)
Destroy All Slackers - An Animated Feature Film|failed|"Destroy All Slackers is a traditionally animated movie in the style of Mission Hill, Gravity Falls, or Regular Show that tells the story of a group of early 20's slackers from New Jersey who love video games, music, hanging out, and partying.     Kail is a 22 year old dude who starts a band with his friends Spade, Dazz, Squadman, and CJ as a way to hang out, party, and most importantly, impress Molly, the girl he's currently crushing on who's a regular customer at the video store he works at. Things start to go wrong when Kail takes an offer from a greedy record producer who wants to make him into a superstar. Thinking he's leaving behind a legacy that would make his late father proud, as well as impress the girl of his dreams, Kail leaves his friends behind in search of fame and fortune. Can the guys get their best friend and lead singer back? Should they even want him back?The script was written by comedian Kris Kail and was partially based on real life experiences working at a video store, playing in a band, and chasing after girls. Kat Fajardo serves as the lead artist on the film, a student of cartooning at the School of Visual Arts in New York City, her unique style gives the small town of Mushroom Hill, New Jersey and its inhabitants their distinctive look. In the sound department we have original electronic music by Sam Glover, as well as songs from Harpoon Forever, The Indecision, Former Fat Boys, The Megas, Age of Animals, Smaller Than You, and more!The main characters of Kail, Spade, Dazz, and Squadman were originally created for various webcomics in the early to mid 2000's by Kris Kail, Bill Sweet, Daniel Loyall ""Dazz"" Brown (from The Spriter's Resource), and Rikk Richardson (from The Indecision and Smaller Than You). With permission from their original creators, writer/director Kris Kail revamped these characters and repurposed them for Destroy All Slackers, while also adding new characters to fill the void (also based on people Kail knew through out the years).Model Sheets for Kail and MollyOur goal is to make a feature length animated movie on a small budget for an older audience of video game and comic book fans, but can also appeal to a wider demographic.I completed the first draft of the script in the Summer of 2010, following it with several drafts between then and May 2012. We began recording voices in the Spring of 2011, finished recording them in July 2012, and began assembling the audio into listenable audio tracks complete with sound effects and music which were finished in September 2012. As I was working on the audio, Kat was drawing storyboards for each scene based on my audio tracks, as well as finishing up character model sheets and other pieces of concept art.Now that the entire film is laid out in front of us, the only task left is to have the animation produced and make any fixes that we can to make the overall project more polished and refined. Linterna Magicá, an Argentinian animation studio who worked on the 2010 Emmy Award winning PBS spot ""Explore"", will be handling the animation for Destroy All Slackers. We've already raised some funds for the project via private investors, but now we need to raise the rest of it. We set our goal at $75,000 because that's the bare minimum we can get away with for animation production to still have it look good, but if we were to raise $200,000 we could make Destroy All Slackers the best it can be and also give free HD digital downloads of the film to everyone who's backed the project, not just those who spent $10 or more, so get 200,000 of your buddies to back $1 each and we'll be in business.Everyone from the musicians to the voice actors to the audio specialists to Kat and myself have worked on this project voluntarily as a labor of love with the hopes of it becoming successful. I personally want it to be a success, not so I can be a rich fat cat sitting atop a pile of gold coins, but so that I can share the gold coins with our loving crew and continue to make cartoons specifically for our audience.For the incentives we tried to make them both cool and affordable, this way we don't waste our entire budget making cool merchandise for the backers and we're left with nothing to make the movie with. DVD/Blu-Ray (Your Choice) - w/ Special Features like a Making Of Featurette and more.Limited Edition T-Shirt (Design Pending)11"" x 17"" Poster (Design Pending, Not Pictured)27"" x 40"" Theatrical Release Poster (Design Pictured Below, Subject to Change)The Art of Destroy All Slackers Trade Paperback (Not Pictured) Featuring Production Art and Concept Art by Kat Fajardo and Making-of Stories by Writer/Director Kris KailAnything not listed above only comes in the package that it was mentioned in. If a package says ""ALL OF THE ABOVE +"" it's referring to anything listed above as well as whatever's mentioned in that incentive.We're also going to be producing little things like pins, buttons, stickers, more postcards, etc that we'll throw in with packages on a random basis.Remember, the more you spend the more you'll get, but we tried to make it so that even the people just chipping in $5 get something cool to hold on to.~90 minutes, 2.39:1 aspect ratioOriginal character designs and art direction by cartoonist Kat FajardoTraditional animation provided by Emmy Award Winning Argentinian animation studio Linterna MagicáIndie/Ska/Punk/Video Game Rock/Rap soundtrack featuring songs from Harpoon Forever, The Indecision, Former Fat Boys, Smaller Than You, and The MegasVoices by comedian Kris Kail, Harpoon Forever frontman Alex Goldstein, Hip Priest actor Tom Conway, and several members of the Voice Acting Alliance.We plan to release the film via a Road Show Tour across America in the Summer of 2014 (Small theaters, comic book/anime conventions, etc), followed by a DVD/Blu-Ray/Digital Download release in the Fall of 2014 (Dates/plan subject to change)We will be participating in the Kicking It Forward project, which means when Destroy All Slackers starts to turn a profit we'll be using 5% of the profits to back YOUR Kickstarter projects. If I become a rich fat cat off this flick I personally promise to get heavily involved in backing on Kickstarter on a regular basis outside of that 5% promise. This movie is for fans of video games, comics, movies, and anime, but can be enjoyed by anyone who's ever hated their job, thrown a party just to try and get with someone, or suspected the dude delivering their pizzas also deals drugs on the side.There are tons of references and in-jokes throughout the entire film that’ll make any nerd smile, and even if you aren’t into Star Fox, Sonic the Hedgehog, Mega Man, Dragon Ball Z, Fist of the North Star, or Assassin’s Creed you can still enjoy the movie so long as you enjoy relatable characters in engaging situations. Regards to Uncle Sonic for making us kids into the adults we are today, and for making this movie possible. You'll understand what I mean when you watch the movie.For more information about Destroy All Slackers, check out our production blog on Tumblr: http://www.destroyallslackers.com/Development on the film is 100% done. The script is written and finalized, the characters are designed, the final look of the film is done, and all the voices are recorded. The only thing left is the animation, which is why the budget on this movie is so low. In fact, most if not all of the money we raise is going straight to the animation studio overseas so they can keep working on the movie. The major risk/challenge here would be getting the animation done on time. As long as we have the money, there's nothing stopping this train, but there could be flaws and goofs in the animation that will need to be addressed and could slow the train down.One thing people don’t take into account is Kickstarter and Amazon’s fee (5% each), as well as the cost for the incentives themselves. I estimate that the incentives will cost us up to $20,000 (this includes shipping), but this estimation leaves room for extra stuff we can sell off on our web store later. In a perfect world this Kickstarter reaching $200,000 would pay for everything just fine, and give us room to make some of the more important scenes that much better. Regardless, the latest the incentives will ship will be around the time the movie comes out on DVD, if we go over our goal though I'll make a point to ship some of the incentives early."
Seeker Aerial Video Drone|failed|Long Duration Flight is critical when Aerial Video Drones are used by Search and Rescue Teams... Fire Departments... and Police Departments. Seeker Copters has solved the problem and achieves Long Duration Flights. Some of our Seeker Copter platform and battery configurations can fly 45 - 60 minutes.Aerial drones offer tremendous opportunities to make our lives better in so many ways that we cannot list them all... but... here are a few:Search & Rescue - traverse large expanses of ground while streaming video to find people who are in need of assistance.Fire Departments - use aerial drones to observe fires as they are being fought to make sure that your people are safe and the fire is being managed efficiently.Police Departments - aerial observation of crowds and hostage situations without needing a helicopter every time.Crop Management - see the health and condition of your crops in areas where you cannot easily get to by ground.Wild Hog Management - find the hogs from the air so you can get to them on the ground.Each of the above uses for an aerial drone have a requirement for long flight times, however, one of the biggest challenges with current technology is that most drones cannot fly for very long.We believe that we can extend the flight times even longer by using some of the newer battery technologies that are coming. Your support of this Kickstarter program will assist us in building the R & D foundation we need to continue our work.Chief Engineer Lynn Cromer holding a Seeker prototype..(Note: The seeker has a 700 mm span making it more stable in the air.) When you have a critical mission, such as Search & Rescue, fire observation, or a police hostage surveillance situation, you need to be able to stay in the air for long durations. Having to land frequently to change batteries could mean the difference between life and death.(Here is a chart showing the flight data for a 7 minutes 30 seconds flight. Note: At the end of the flight about 75% of the available battery power was remaining.)Seeker Flight StatisticsSeeker Copters, Inc. has solved the problem of achieving long duration flight by an innovative use of batteries, motors, power distribution systems, and electronics that uses less energy and lightens the airframe. Lighter airframes and lower power consumption add up to longer flight times. Like most things in life, it is really pretty simple when you know what you are doing.Seeker Copters are built with extremely high quality components that last longer and are more efficient. We build serious machines... not toys. The people who buy our machines demand the finest quality because they know that cutting corners is not how you gain quality and reliability.Seeker taking off for a flight.The Federal Aviation Agency does not currently allow companies to use aerial drones for commercial applications in the United States... and even Search and Rescue use is questionable. The FAA is certainly causing many good uses of aerial drones to be postponed due to a lack of regulatory clarity. Seeker Copters are designed specifically for people who demand professional, commercial, quality construction... such as Fire Departments, and Search and Rescue Teams. Seeker Copters are suitable for any application where performance is desired and reliability is required.Seeker in flight on a Search & Rescue mission.Our standard 5,000 mah battery will keep the Seeker aloft 25-30 minutes with a normal payload. Our specially constructed 10,200 mah battery pack the Seeker can fly 30-45 minutes with a normal payload attached depending on flight conditions. When you attach the 13,600 mah battery pack the Seeker can fly 45-60 minutes with a normal payload... depending on wind and flight conditions.Seekers come either as Kits or Pre-Assembled. The Seeker Airframe is designed to be:Light weight - carbon fiber and fiberglass structural components are chosen for both strength and flexibility.Flexible - you can configure the airframe with components to customize your Seeker as your mission requires.Close Up of an Assembled Seeker AirframeSeeker Airframe : KITThe Seeker Airframe is the superstructure framework on which all other components are attached. The Airframe is composed of a combination of carbon fiber, fiberglass, and electronic components. The Seeker Airframe is custom designed to provide maximum flight stability and longevity with the combination of motors and batteries and electronic components that are suggested. The Seeker Airframe is also designed to suspend the camera system in such a fashion that the airframe and the propellers do not show in videos that you shoot while flying.Central Airframe components manufactured by Seeker Copters.Included KIT components are:1 – Seeker Airframe components, and 2 – Four 390 KV 22p motors w/ power supply cables, and 3 – One Power Distribution Buss, and4 – Four (4) Electronic Speed Controllers, and5 – Carbon Fiber Propellers (1 set of 4 propellers), and6 – Landing Gear, and6 – All mounting and assembly hardware.This is the full Airframe Kit with all components and assembly hardware included.Close Up of Power Distribution Buss on AirframeNOTE: All component parts will be provided along with instructions for assembly. You will need a screw driver, some allen wrenches, and similar tools to assemble. You will also need to perform some soldering. It is important that you be proficient in soldering as improper soldering can cause the components to malfunction. Please do not attempt to assemble the components if you are not experienced at soldering.Airframe Assembly Process nearing completion.Optional equipment not included but needed to fly:Battery*, and Autopilot (Flight Controller) w/ GPS, andRadio receiver, and aRC Transmitter if you don’t already have one.Additional Equipment Commonly Flown:Camera, and aCamera Gimbal, and a Video Down-link if you want to stream video or fly in FPV mode.Airframe Top Level Structure Assembled* NOTE: The batteries that is provided by Seeker Copters are all custom designs that permits longer flight time. Most batteries in the 5,000 mah to 5,200 mah range are built with 4 Lithium Ion cells linked in series. The 5000 mah Seeker Copter battery has 6 Lithium Polymer cells linked in series. If you fly the Seeker with any other battery you will likely not be able to fly as long as with the Seeker Copter battery.Optional Equipment items can be purchased separately if you do not already have them. A list of compatible equipment and supply sources will be provided along with a set of comprehensive and detailed assembly instructions. NOTE: Texas Residents will be charged Sales Taxes of 8.25% on the Rewards Price prior to shipment. We will contact you after the Kickstarter Program has been completed to arrange payment of Sales Taxes.NOTE: All Rewards will be shipped via U.S. Postal Service Bulk Rate Freight with insurance and tracking and delivery receipt required. If you wish to have your Reward shipped via Fed-Ex or UPS we will be glad to accommodate your wish. In such cases there will be an additional shipping fee for the difference... typically about $10 - $15 depending on location.Aerial Drones are experiencing rapid increases in sales as the general public realizes that drone technology has matured to the point where nearly anyone can learn to fly a drone with minimal practice. Because of this the companies that supply components occasionally experience backlogs in their ability to deliver components in a timely fashion. We have been in contact with the suppliers we intend to use and have been assured that our order quantities will be no problem to fill in a timely fashion, however, this is subject to change due to the dynamic nature of the market.We have a production and distribution facility already under lease and do not foresee any problems with the production process nor with the fulfillment process, however, it is certainly possible that unforeseen circumstances may arise that inhibit our ability to produce or fulfill our sales within the time we projected. If delays in delivery of components occur, and/or if our sales volume significantly exceeds our expectations, it is conceivable that we may have a slight delay in delivering some of the units that we have sold. Of course, if we find that our delivery dates will be delayed we will keep you informed.We will deliver all rewards in the sequence in which they are sold. This means that in case of any delays we will deliver the first units sold first and work our way through the backlog as quick as possible.Please Note... If you are a resident of the State of Texas we must collect and pay State Sales Taxes in the amount of 8.25%. We will contact you prior to shipment of your Reward(s) and arrange to collect payment for the Sales Taxes. We will not be able to ship to Texas Residents prior to collecting Sales Taxes.
Quikceipt! Paperless Solutions|failed|" Paper receipts are soon to be a thing of the past with Quikceipt! Our plan to provide a universal platform for all transactions. Reducing huge paper waste and improving our earth while allowing companies to save millions on paper.Paperless receipts create an amazing opportunity:Retailers gain valuable customer data. Electronic receipts need to be delivered somewhere; more than likely, email is the delivery mechanism. If consumers buy into electronic receipts, they may well provide an email address. If retailers can market through these emails in a way that benefits the retailer and the consumer, there's a win-win opportunity.Consumers get special offers. Most of us don't like irrelevant, aggressive marketing, but we all love good deals on things we truly want or need. When marketing is relevant, we love it. Of course, this requires some give and take. If we are willing to give up more of our personal shopping history and an email, the better marketers will make it worth our while.Consumers can track their spending. A structured data standard for electronic receipts would enable item-level data that would power more insightful personal finance tools. Overall, it's not the most difficult engineering challenge.Retailers and consumers gain efficiency. A paperless organization is a better organization. It's all in PDF format, on a server, backed up and searchable for everyone that needs it – in seconds. This benefit would apply to retailers and consumers. Our team has a specific plan set in place with achievable milestones that will be met on time. From closing a round of funding here to launching mid 2015. With the correct help, our app can be in the hands of thousands of people as early as next year!

We look forward to having your support as a backer!For the sake of time we will keep this portion very short and direct. Challenges:1) Scalability through cloud server infrastructure.2) Generating reliable triggers within the platform for confirmed receipt deliverability. 3) Convincing major retailers to promote paperless spending. (This may be easier depending on the acknowledgement of cost efficiency.4) Gaining top of mind awareness through spreading an invitation-only like marketing strategy. 5) Informing the public consumer of the benefits of paperless spending.Our risks are actually summed up above as well. The main risk here is informing the public consumer and getting them to take action. How do we plan on accomplishing this task?It all comes down to providing real incentives, mainly monetary, to convince people that they will personally benefit as well as the environment. It seems clear that the main problem here is inertia. We are accustomed to paper receipts; some people really want them. It is, in large part, a generational thing. The desire for a tangible, paper receipt is probably more common amongst older consumers.The challenge with realizing most of these benefits is that there are hundreds of millions of consumers and millions of retailers. Getting everyone to change their ways and embrace technology isn't easy. In fact, it's near impossible to enact quickly.However, almost all consumer and retailers have a relationship with credit card companies – Visa, Mastercard, American Express and the banks that issue the cards. These intermediaries have a tremendous opportunity to drive the evolution to electronic receipts and make money facilitating the aforementioned benefits. The control these companies hold is incredible.Think about how you can help drive the change and profit in the process."
Splendid Entities: The Catalog Project|successful|"I am excited to tell you that ""Splendid Entities: 25 Years of Objects by Phyllis Green"" will open at the Ben Maltz Gallery, Otis College of Art and Design in January 2011. Curated by Tim Christian and Jo Lauria, this survey exhibition will include over forty pieces produced by me between 1985, when my professional career began in Los Angeles, and 2010. (See my website, www.phyllisgreen.net, for images of my work.)This is an incredible opportunity for me! I believe that a color catalog is an important component to document the exhibition and to demonstrate the evolution of my work and artistic achievements. While Otis College will generously provide design and distribution services for the catalog, I must raise money to cover the production costs. Raising the catalog production costs is what this Kickstarter campaign is all about!Meg Linton, Director of Ben Maltz Gallery, has advised that the minimum amount needed to proceed is $7500. Thanks to the generosity of some dear friends and collectors, I have raised $2500. I was recently awarded a City of Santa Monica Artist Project Fellowship that provides another $2500. I must raise at least another $2500 by the end of the summer. THE MORE MONEY I RAISE, THE BETTER THE QUALITY OF THE CATALOG, AND THE MORE INFORMATION IT WILL HOLD.Please consider purchasing a catalog NOW! A contribution of $25. will reserve a signed copy of the catalog, personally inscribed to you, upon publication and will make you a ""Splendid Friendity #1"". See the other backer award categories! The minimum contribution is $10, and all contributions are safe and secure. Send me a message via the link on this page if you need more information.YOU ARE SPLENDID! THANK YOU!"

The Ale House String Band's Debut Album|successful|"Hi and thanks for stopping by. We are The Ale House String Band, and we're tired of saying ""Not yet..."" when asked about CD's at our live shows! Now don't get us wrong, we've tried to put out a self-produced album, but setting your own vocal level without an extra set of ears can be problematic. We've got a well-worn demo CD floating around out there somewhere. If you look hard enough you're sure to find a copy or two decorating someone's rear-view mirror...But in all seriousness, this CD project is our life for the next couple of months. It is tentatively labeled ""Rough Cut and Duty Free"", with ""Sot Salvation"" and ""Saints and Sinners"" also in contention for the album title. We have a total of 17 tracks recorded thanks to our friend Jud Caswell of ""Frog Hollow Studio"" in Brunswick, Maine. We will be returning to the studio on May 11th to record some last minute songs and to put a bit of polish on the tracks. You can check out the studio here: https://www.facebook.com/FrogHollowStudioJon and Kate Mess will be our graphic designers.

Not only that but we are meeting with our graphic designers Kate and Jon Mess this Sunday (5/26) to go over some ideas!Even though we're working with professionals, we're still looking to our fans and asking them to send us their pictures and ideas. If you have a crazy kooky idea for album art jot it down, take a picture of it, and email it to us! No creativity will be turned away!This Kickstarter will completely fund the CD production costs. We donated all of our St. Paddy's day gig money to pay for the cost of the recording and mixing, and we just need your help to get it out into the world! Our tentative release date is June 17th, with a solid release date of July 1st. The CD's will be packaged in 100% recycled cardboard packs that will have a barcode so that they can be purchased in your local CD stores. The tracks for the album will be available for online purchase via CD Baby, Amazon, and ITunes. If you are a fan, and you love our music as much as we do, please help us out... Thank-you.-April, Oren, and Brian... AHSBThe only possible set-back that we can see would be if any of our tracks have volume issues during the mastering process. In the event that this happens, production could be pushed back while we re-record those tracks. Even so, we don't anticipate a delay of more than one month."
New Cornell Hurd Band CD...Great new songs you'll love!|successful|"Hello myfriends - This upcomingCornell Hurd Band CD will be our 20th self-produced and self-released CD. Very few bandshave done anything close to this.Releasing aself-produced CD can cost anywhere from 10K-25K depending on several factors.We’ve been making our own records and CDs since 1974, so we've learned a lotabout how to produce a CD efficiently.On this CD we’re only recording originals, so royalty payments to other writerswill be ZERO.We produce our own records. We do NOT pay for an outside producer. Studio timeand engineering only.Our producer, Allen Crider, owns his own facility. This basically cuts ourcosts by one-half in this area.I don’t over-press. We learned this lesson the hard way. Generally, we press2,000 copies only in our first wave.For the most part, the CHB plays on its own records. Very little spent onoutside players.What are the expenses?1) Studio time2) Studio engineering3) Musicians4) Graphics5) Photography6) Printing and pressing of CDs (approx $2500)7) Shipping/promo costsPROGRESS: Onceagain, some of the pre-production work has already been done. Some of thefunding we can, as on every project, provide ourselves.Initial tracks have been produced on thefollowing songs:1) Over the Hill and Down the Road 2) The Death of A Honky-Tonk Fool3) Pretty Little Lies 4) Blues for the Big State5) The Company of Strangers6) While the Band Plays ""Every Time We Say Goodbye""7) (Real Love is) A Hard Act To Follow8) Life as You Want It9) Your Faith in Me10) She's Like Brown Sugar 11) The One You Still Love12) Cemetery Road13) Instrumental14) Coming Down (After Being in Love)We have beenperforming Pretty Little Lies, Over the Hill and Down the Road and Blues for the Big State to anoverwhelmingly positive response for months. We think this will be an excellentCD.ANY funds wereceive above our pledge goal will be used to produce this CD. All money willbe accounted for.thanks forstopping by,Cornell HurdRisks and challenges?By participating, you've entered SHOW BIZ, as tough a business as exists on the planet. You are to be commended for your courage. It's a business where almost anything can go wrong.BUT, by joining forces with the CHB, you've hooked up with a band that has released nineteen previous CDs and has been in fact, making commercial recordings since the mid 'seventies.Hang on.The exact release date is, of course, dependent on a number of factors. We hope to release this CD by August. ALL OTHER rewards are shipped shortly after successful conclusion of this Kickstarter effort."

FOLLOW ME - HELP US GET BARNEY|failed|"												My name is Jessica Portillo and I'm a passionate photographer in the fashion realm. I've recently begun to branch out into short films and I've been fortunate to assemble a truly exceptional group of talented people to collaborate with on my new vision, Cinematographer Walter Diaz, and Film Editor Siena Sivrican. Together we plan to create a three minute short film about exploration, fantasy, fashion, and the bond between cats and the humans they love. BARNEYIn order to establish a certain level of production value while still maintaining my aesthetic we've decided to make a considerable investment in my casting and equipment choices, which is what brought me here. The only expense that is left to cover is Barney, a trained British short-hair cat, complete with two wranglers and a charming smile. Barney (Photo Provided by Paws for Effect)I felt it necessary to include a professional/working animal in my film in order to achieve the performance we will need, while keeping him and my team safe on a busy production. CHARACTERS Story Board by Jessica PortilloThe lead is a young girl (early twenties, late teens), dressed in pink and cream. We find her lost in the woods and looking for a way home. she stumbles upon a beautiful gray cat. He seems adorable yet mysterious-almost magical.Styling Inspiration for The Lead CharacterThe magic cat senses the girls bewilderment and in an attempt to comfort her, leads her deeper into the woods to his lair. We start to catch a glimpse of glowing sets of eyes as they make their way through the darkness. The magic cat thinks nothing of it-they're his magical cat-like companions. But the young girl is growing uneasy as she sees more and more of these ""monsters""beginning to appear. In a moment of panic and desperation the girl grabs the mysterious cat and clutches him close to her chest. The cat senses her fear and in a flash he brings the two of them back to the girl's reality.  The monsters are a part of the magical cat's alternate reality where he rules over every creature. This is why they cower in the darkness and never act aggressively towards him or the lost girl.   LOCATIONLocationsFirst third of the film takes place in a dark moonlit forest. This is where the girl has her initial interaction with the cat. (soft lighting, with a cool palette).Second third of the film takes place in the monster world which is an alternate version of the forest (lit with vibrant gels, reds, oranges, purples).Third part of the film takes place in the forest lit by morning light. (soft but bright light, warm toned and refreshing).																			I feel that dealing with logistical and technical setbacks is a challenge on every shoot. I've been lucky to have found other inspired people to collaborate with and support, and in turn they support me. At this point in my career I feel confident in my ability to deal handle complications as they arise and make adjustments to plans as necessary. The biggest challenge will be achieving an aesthetic in video that I'm striving for. But that's why I'm so excited to have involved an amazing director of photography and editor as well as an enthusiastic and hard-working crew."

Tankwork: Cooperative Tank Action|failed|At Aplexio, some of our fondest memories of playing games are of the times when we were able to team up and overcome a challenge in a game. We would yell, cheer, and give each other high-fives for a job well done. Over the years, video games have grown away from the shared experiences of being in the same room. Most new games use the internet, where people have the convenience of being across town or anywhere in the world. Sadly, our group of friends rarely plays video games in the same room anymore. While we enjoy being able to connect with our good old friends (and friends we have yet to meet) in an online game, we are beginning to miss the times we had playing video games in the same room.Booyah! High-five!Lately, we have been playing more board games to have the shared experience of being in the same room. There are many great board games that are doing an awesome job of creating this same-room experience. However, when we try playing cooperative board games, we find that there is a tendency for there to be one person who knows the game really well. The new players will follow this person’s advice every round, and the new players seem to be there just to hold the cards.You got this one? Ok.With Tankwork, we are aiming to bring back the feelings of camaraderie we once had in video games. We started this project with a pie-in-the-sky dream of making an amazing AAA title with a large number of features, but we immediately realized that we need to do something more fiscally responsible. Despite cutting back, our vision with Tankwork has remained on creating a same-room, cooperative experience and on teamwork. Tankwork’s design involves difficult levels and bosses that are tough-as-nails to play single-player but significantly easier with a second player, depending on your ability to cooperate.I can't handle this situation alone.The robots are on the rise. They want to put a stop to progress made by cooperation. It is your team’s objective to put a stop to them. We hope you will see that these self-centered robots are crushed under your superior teamwork and are no match for your customized tanks.Check out my paint job!The game’s current design features:PC exclusive (We will be considering consoles later in our development)Single player modeTwo player same-screen cooperative modeVariety of weapon typesWeak enemies, strong enemies, and bossesClassic top-down arcade-style viewPickups to help upgrade your tankCustomizable tank abilitiesTank decalsTank color choicesHere are some examples of what we currently have in our design.Desert EnvironmentThis is a view of some of the environmental elements we've made for our early tests. Environments in our design include desert (seen above), grassland, city, robot base, and volcanic. Each of these environments will be used in multiple levels, and their elements may mix together to build on the game's narrative.Mobile Energy Cannon BotThis is your basic mobile robot foe. It is armed with the standard energy cannon and will try to hunt you down. This bot's strength is getting close enough to you that you don't have time to avoid it's energy shots. Hop from cover point to cover point and shoot at it when you've got a clear shot.Artillery Turret BotMeet the artillery bot. This piece of machinery will keep you on your toes. It's shots are slow yet deadly. It lobs powerful explosives over most obstacles that provide cover, ensuring that you can't hide in the same position for very long. This bot will likely be hiding just out of reach, making it a long lasting foe.Beam Turret BotOh look! What do we have here? It's a beam turret bot, loaded with a beam cannon. Beam cannons are some very heavy weaponry with long range capabilities. The constant beam makes leaving cover nearly impossible without sustaining continuous damage. However, the weight of its weapon causes the beam turret bot to turn slowly, making it vulnerable to your quick speed. Get in close, and run circles around it.Stationary Missile LauncherYou would think that a bot that can't aim at you wouldn't be a threat, but this missile-launching bot will find you as you are plowing through a long passageway. It's missiles are fast and deadly.  Shoot them down before they tear right through your tank's plating.Mobile Flame Thrower BotI've nicknamed this bot aunt Rosie. Why? Because they both chase you down to give you a fiery red kiss of death. Your best course of action when faced with a mobile flame thrower bot is to flee—flee like your life depends on it! It's best to find a path that offers your ally a clear shot at this killing machine and keep retracing the path until your ally takes it out of commission.Boss BotI haven't seen this model of bot before. It must be one of those custom models uniquely designed to make life difficult. I have a sneaking suspicion that we will run into a handful of these things before we crush the robot uprising. This model looks to have weapons on every side, and there is no cover anywhere in sight. This is looking to be a tough fight. Good thing your ally is there to back you up.Our design is not finalized. We would like to hear from you about the designs you have for our game. We will be listening to your advice on Kickstarter, and hopefully on our own website once we've established a way to keep an open line of communication. We will also listen to your suggestions e-mailed directly to AplexioLLC@gmail.com for those of you who have great ideas but don't want to expose yourself to potentially unwelcome comments from other community members. Your teamwork on this game is very much appreciated. We believe that everyone on the Tankwork team should be informed about the development of this game, so we ask that you visit our development blog at aplexio.com/blog for progress updates. We require all developers who are working on this project to post an update at least once a month starting with this Kickstarter, and encourage them to post their progress as they feel noteworthy.Aplexio’s belief is that games are art that deeply touch peoples’ lives. There are many ways they can do this, and Aplexio hopes to make many games that can touch peoples’ lives in many meaningful ways. We hope that Tankwork will help you  grow closer to your friends and loved ones as you work together to overcome the challenges that Tankwork provides.Aplexio can only make this possible with your financial support. Even though our programmer has been able to save enough to cover his bare minimum costs from previous jobs, our artist has not been fortunate enough to find a higher salary job to support his growing family through the entirety of the Tankwork project.  With your continued support, we can complete the core of this project without the need for publisher involvement. The more support we receive, the more we will be able to afford. This could include more levels, level variation, enemies (bosses & enemy variants), tank abilities, tank decals, tank upgrades, game balance, and fine-tuned polish on the game.  We would like, instead of setting stretch goals, to hear from you and implement the most desired improvements to the game.An early sample of what the Print reward may look likeBrent Wilkerson: ProgrammerI’m a game fanatic and can’t see myself doing anything other than making games for a career. I graduated college with a degree in Computer Science, a minor in Mathematics, and Game Development Certification. Unfortunately, I was not able to find a game development position after my apprenticeship ended, and the company I worked for could not afford a new full-time engineer. I’ve invested in Aplexio as a way to show that we can make games that make a difference in peoples’ lives, and I hope we can make many meaningful games for years to come.My favorite games include the Zelda series, MegaMan series, “Tales of…” series, and StarCraft. My favorite genres are Action Adventure, Tactical RPGs, Strategy, and Puzzle games. I’m currently addicted to Splatoon, and I regularly play Mario Maker. (I love making games)Alex Platt: ArtistI’m the Artist and second half of Aplexio. I’ve always loved to draw and paint. I’ve worked as an Architectural Visualization Artist, 3d Modeler, and a Commissioned fine artist. I have won many awards at art shows, and I’m a regularly featured artist at a local Chalk Art Festival. I love traditional oil landscapes and portraits and charcoal drawings, but some of my favorite art is quite nontraditional; digital art like Sparth’s, graphic novels, and Hayao Miyazaki’s work in animation and manga.I’ve loved video games all my life. I still have vivid memories of playing Rampage and Virus on my dad’s Atari ST. Back then my dad did some programming for games, and my mom produced art for Atari ST games. I’ve been loving games ever since. I've loved games on DOS, Amiga, Super Nintendo, N64, PS1-PS3, Gamecube and Wii, but my favorite games have been on PC. Lately, I’ve been enjoying MGSV and my Mig 21 on DCS World. My favorite genres are Strategy, FPSs, and Simulations, but I’m not too picky. I’m also an avid board gamer and enjoy games like Star Wars X-wing, Combat Commander, Terra Mystica, and Eclipse.This is our first game as a company, and we expect many new challenges to arise. Fortunately, we have worked through many of these challenges during our training period earlier this past year. These challenges have been solved with open, candid conversations, with advice from professionals with years of experience, and, most frequently, with a web search. We plan to continue overcoming challenges as they arise, using these resources. When there is a significant challenge for this project, we will post details about the challenge and how we plan to overcome it. We will also be considering the advice you give, as part of the community. Your support and understanding of unforeseen challenges is much appreciated.We are small and flexible, with no red tape that is frequently required in bigger companies. When a change is required, we won't need to get dozens of people on board with the change.Many games take significantly longer than anticipated. If this project proves to be too big for our desired time frame, we are committed to finish the project and will finish it in a longer time frame by finding extra work to pay our bills and support our families. Your pledge is extremely valuable to Aplexio, and in return, we want to protect it even more than our own personal investment in Aplexio. Thank you for making this dream come true.
Winter in Mind EP Funding|successful|"Hey there! Here's the deal: For the past ten months, bit by bit, I've been working on recording a six song EP with  the amazing producer/composer/sound mastermind Jacob Goldman. The songs are there! The sounds are there! The album is almost there! I have spent days and days and dollars and dollars to get this far, but I need your help in order to make this something you can hold in your hands and put in your ears. Mastering and printings costs add up to over $2500, and without your help, this album won't see the bright light of the good day. I would really appreciate any $$ you can offer, and in exchange I promise you a beautiful record, to hear and to hold.Here's the story: WINTER PART I: About three years ago I sat down at the desk in my dorm room, a little bit heartsick, either because of a boy or because of the paper I hadn't yet written that night, and wrote my first song, ""I Wish I Were a Bird."" A year later I recorded my debut full-length album, No Town, with Colorado musician and producer Eric Shiveley. Thanks to a strange pizza fate and a German guardian angel named Lars, I took my debut album with me to Europe, where I played in Germany, Spain, and Portugal, and then across the Western U.S., touring across eleven states and driving three thousand miles alone in a Buick LeSabre. Whew! I took a lot of naps in parks that summer.  WINTER PART II: Last December I met producer/composer Jacob Goldman at a house show in New Haven. I rescued him from a fire and then asked if he'd help me record my next album. ""Sure,"" he said, because what else can you say to someone who has just saved your life, or at least your turtleneck sweater. ""Great,"" I said. ""I have a million songs ready to go."" I didn't, in fact, have a million songs. I only had one or two, and I spent a week that month in my childhood home in Colorado writing the rest. Sometimes I got frustrated and took a walk in the snow (often it took hours to regain feeling in my legs post snow-walk). Sometimes I ate enchiladas. I returned to New Haven in January and Jake and I camped out in a third floor studio for three weeks to record the six songs I'd just written. We wore hats. I was always late. We brought in our friends to play their fancy instruments (a handmade violin! a mint and bubble gum pink electric guitar!). We wondered what it would be like if it were warm enough to go outside to play basketball. The end of January came quickly, and recording had to take a pause while ""real life"" pulled us back into its onerous tides. SUMMER: After a six month studio hiatus, a life across the Atlantic, a college diploma, and a long email chain with the subject line ""BIG PLAANS!"" we returned to the third floor to finish recording and mixing the album. It didn't last long. We were again interrupted, this time by the long days of summer and a three week tour of the southeast. We packed up my guitar, Jake's mini drum kit, and some trail mix from the fancy local food coop, and headed south. We played for barefooted teenagers, wine drunk psychiatrists, and a rotting porch watermelon. We loved it, and we ate many hamburgers along the way. FALL: We returned to the northeast, summer ended, though we didn't know when, exactly, and Jake finished mixing the album. It's almost winter, now, and it's time to get these six songs out into the world before they collect too much digital dust somewhere in a Brooklyn apartment. They are peeking out from a blanket of binary waiting for you launch them into the next stage of their little lives!WINTER PART III: ? ? ? ? !! ? ?!?!?!? It's coming. I hope you will be a part of it.Please, have Winter in Mind. ! xo LaurelinI am very close to finishing this album - Songs - check! Artwork - check! - and with your generous support I will be able to fund the final steps. Here's what's next!1. Songs will be sent off to be mastered!2. Stumptown Printers will print beautiful sleeves to house these sounds.3. I will send the EP and any other rewards your way. While I am hoping to release the album by the end of November, mastering and printing could potentially take additional time as I work with others to finalize audio and art and wait for the good 'ol pony express to ship the EP to me (and then to you!) I want to get this to you as soon as possible but please keep these things in mind as you eagerly await Winter. Thanks!"

It needs a new bar, a newfloor, tables, and chairs, and the facade needs to be redone. The existing baris small, and because we are planning a fantastic cocktail program, we want thesize and quality of the bar to equal that of the wine and cocktails. The existingfloor is old carpet, and that just won't do for the beautiful restaurant wewant to create. Things have been changing in restaurants, from the way peopleexpect to eat and be served to the place where it all happens, and we want tobe at the forefront of those changes. We aren't planning anything fancy, but weknow that if we are going to be successful, Shakewell needs an update. We aredoing this on a tight budget, but we still need your help! *Many thanks are in order for putting this campaign together, including Aaron Delman (aaron.delman@gmail.com) for his videographer skills, Sara Delman for her Production and editing skills,  and Tessa Swigart for her keen eye thank you!The biggest Risk we are facing is securing the location, if we do not raise enough funding by August 26, 2013, we will loose the space and have to begin looking all over again. We love the space and it has tremendous potential, it will be a success with your help.One of the challenges for Shakewell will be maintaining a strong and continually developing relationship with the local community whilst running a busy restaurant. We hope by ensuring that this is an integral part of our business plan from the start this relationship will grow and remain a main focus for ourselves and our restaurant family.Restaurants have a history of failure which can be scary but we think those failures often happen because of mismanagement, unrealistic financial goals and lack of work ethic. We want to take on this challenge because we're opening this restaurant for all the right reasons. We're not looking to hit it big, we want to create a family in our restaurant--a family that is made up of staff, purveyors and suppliers and of course, our guests. We are both extremely competent people with lots of experience with restaurant financials, food costs, and just about everything else that you need to run a restaurant the right way. It is not an easy life but we love what we do and we work hard to make everything we do great. This restaurant will be our home we share with you! Another challenge in opening Shakewell Bar and Kitchen is the economy. We are very hopeful with the direction the economy is going these days, but there are still valid fears that we aren't in the clear yet. However, we've seen that historically, dips in the general economy have less impact on neighborhood restaurants than they do on most other segments of the economy. To some degree this is because food, regardless of whether it is from the grocery or a restaurant is a fundamental necessity of life and consumers spend accordingly.  In addition, levels and price points found in the industry allow for accommodation of changing financial circumstances, making it possible for restaurant businesses to succeed in a variety of economic climates. The prices at Shakewell will be very competitive and will allow for a diverse group of diners.Lastly, Shakewell will likely have challenges during the remodel, with permits or will it be plumbing we don't know but we will deal with each challenge head-on so we can bring this great restaurant to life!
The Lonely Himalayas|successful|"Project SummaryThe Lonely Himalayasis a cinematic effort to document the unprecedented socio-ecological changesoccurring throughout the Kumaon region of the Himalayas.The acceleration of urban migration, coupledwith the ravages of climate change, have left many Kumaoni villages abandoned, their landscapes irrevocably altered.  Byinvolving the youth of West Binsar Valley in filming this documentary, they aregiven an opportunity to learn a professional skill while examining theircultural heritage.Nanda Kot (6,861 m), Kumaon HimalayasProject DescriptionA mere stone’s throw from the Binsar Wildlife Sanctuary lays the sleepy village of Mayoli.  If you squint hard enough, you can see the Nanda Devi Himalayan range from the ridgeline, often obscured from the wreath of pollution generated from the swelling urban centers at the base.  A legion of pine trees dutifully protects the aesthetics of the hillside.  Under starlight, the leopards howl.  Come midday, wild boars terrorize ayurvedic garden beds.  The Kumaon region of the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand, India is unparalleled in its untrammeled access to the Himalayas.  Within Kumaon, the Western Binsar Valley is renowned for its awe-inspiring solace and biological diversity.  However, what may seem like a veritable paradise to foreigners feels like a prison to a younger generation tantalized by images of Bollywood excess, hyper-connectivity to digital surrealities, and the plethora of both professional and educational opportunities in urban settings. Kumaoni women farming in Binsar Valley“My mother does farming and raises cattle.  I know how to do this work because I have seen it from childhood.  In the future, I don’t want to do this work.  I want to get out of this place.”  --Deepa Kandpal, Media Workshop Participant In search of a life quite different from their parents’, Binsar Valley youth abandon their agrarian villages and crowd the over-burdened infrastructure of India’s mega-cities.  Upon urban migration, vital cultural components are lost, including traditions, regional-specific farming methods, folk songs, handicrafts, herbal medicines, even languages.  As politicians unleash free market economic policies and succumb to neoliberal development schemes with multilateral institutions, India is globalizing at breakneck speed.Determined to stem the tide of socio-ecological change, fledgling NGO the Himalayan Ethno Botanic Garden Society (HEBGS) began working with village youth to reexamine their cultural identities.  Utilizing the 15 years of documentary film making experience, HEBGS founders Pankaj Bhakuni and Sachin Bisht began a Media Workshop to teach basic film making and editing skills to Binsar Valley adolescents.  Throughout the process, the teens rediscovered the traditions of their ancestors they had heretofore spurned.  The FilmTwo Kumaoni friends leave the hustle and bustle of Delhi to return to theirhomeland in order to protect remote Himalayan villages.  Two American backpackers stumble upon thismission while in country, become friends with them and volunteer at theircampsite.  While sipping tea over acampfire, the four decide to make this documentary. Media Workshop with Binsar Valley youthThis film will contain several sequences filmed by BinsarValley youth who participate in a media workshop.  Their interviews of village elders willprovide a unique perspective of a generation at a crossroads.  Layered on top of these components areexpansive investigations of environmental changes occurring in Kumaon, such asbiodiversity loss, topsoil degradation, forest succession, climate change,invasive species, glacial melt, and water scarcity.  Alongside urban migration, other sociologicalelements discussed in the film are poverty, political economy, educationaldisparity, separation anxiety, and public health concerns.The FactsSociological change: A demographictransition is occurring in India on a vast scale.  As the middle class expands, consumerspending and consumption increases. This inevitably causes a strain in urbaninfrastructure, such as roads, sewage systems, building, and electricity.  As India modernizes, urban migration isaccelerating from villages like those in Binsar Valley.  As disparities in wealth continue to expandat alarming rates, many urban and seasonal migrants are often relegated tohumble living quarters or makeshift dwellings in slums, a critical socialjustice issue.  Mass urbanization isoccurring for many reasons, among them a dearth of employment opportunities inrural settings, chain migration to unite with family members, and a desire forbetter educational opportunities.  Duringthis process, migrants are often subsumed into a larger globalized culture, astheir ancestral culture often becomes diluted.Ecological change:  Due to climate change, the average temperature of the Himalayas is warming at afaster rate than the global average rate. Temperature increases are greater during the autumn and winter seasonswith faster warming happening at higher altitudes.  Over 67% of the Himalayan glaciers haveretreated.  Climate change will also increase the spread of vector-borne diseases (i.e. Malaria, Dengue Fever, Lyme disease, Bartonellosis, etc.) throughout the Kumaon region, thereby posing an increasingly grave human health risk for vulnerable populations. Biodiversity is decliningthroughout Uttarakhand due to these climatic changes.  In Binsar Valley, traditional broadleaf forests are transitioning to pine forests.  Many endemic species of ayurvedic herbal plants that have been used in medicines for thousands of years are no longer being cultivated, due to the insistence of farmers to prioritize cash crops for export.  Biodiversityloss throughout Kumaon will likely affect rural populations, as theirlivelihoods are almost exclusively dependent on natural resources. Also, soil degradation and erosion are occurring at an alarming rate due to a lack of regeneration of topsoil and over-abundant nutrient loading in agriculture.  Agriculturalvulnerability to climatic shifts has been documented in the Kumaon region, inparticular that of wheat and rice.  Theseshifts will likely exacerbate issues of food insecurity in the region.  Flash flooding has been occurring morefrequently throughout Uttarakhand, including a dangerous episode in the fall of2013, claiming over 5,700 lives.Traditional Kumaoni houseThe FundsThisfilm has been a passion project for everyone on our team, and now we need yourpassion and support to bring awareness to this critical issue.  Our fundraising goal is $3,000.Here are some estimates on where the money will be spent:$1,250: Film-making     equipment (camera, lighting, memory cards, video editing software, etc.) $1,000: Food and lodging for The Lonely Himalayas crew     when traveling to various parts of the Himalayas  $500:  Marketing     the film in the USA through promotional materials (fliers, posters, trailers), film screenings, website design, etc.  This will be accomplished in Chicago. $250:  Generation of donor gifts, including the     packaging costs.  The above-mentioned fundraising goal is what we consider tobe “bare bones.”  In fact, it does noteven include transportation costs (plane, train, bus, and the ever-excitingrickshaw).  However, every additionaldollar will make this documentary even better, while preventing the four of usfrom going broke during the film-making process! ;)  It is important for us to mention that Kickstarter has an ""all or nothing"" funding model.  Thus, until our film is 100% funded, no deductions of your pledged donations will be made from your account.  Even if our film reaches 99% on our last day of fundraising, you will not be charged one penny, nor will we receive one penny.  This gives us considerable pressure to fundraise within 30 days, but gives you the security of only donating to legitimate projects!Apricot blossoms in Binsar ValleyStretch GoalOur stretch goal is $5,000.  The additional funds will go towards makingthe film the best it can be and will allow us to film in more remote areaswhich may require additional transportation, lodging and food costs.  Also, with additional funding, we can putmore efforts into getting it out to the largest audience possible as well asentering our film into various film festivals.  We believe this film to be of utmost importance to documentthe ancient traditions of a culture at a crossroads.  With your help, we can bring awareness tothis issue as well as continue to engage the Binsar Valley youth through film.Team BiographiesRyan Stock - Producer of the Lonely HimalayasRyan Stock –Producerof The Lonely Himalayas, Ryan firstignited his passion about this cause while serving as a volunteer for the Himalayan Ethno Botanic Garden Society duringthe fall of 2013.  Ryan completed a Master’sdegree in Environmental Policy and Environmental Justice from the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor in 2013.  He served in the PeaceCorps Dominican Republic (2007-2009) as a Community Environmental Development volunteer,working with a reforestation NGO in the Cordillera Central Mountains.  Ryan also has a Bachelor’s degree in Anthropologyfrom the University of Utah in 2006. Prior to producing this film, Ryan has extensive experience working inenvironmental education at the University of Michigan and Cuttington Universityin Liberia, climate adaptation in Great Lakes cities, environmental justice atthe Sierra Club Detroit, sustainable agriculture in Gujarat, and zero wasteinitiatives in the Dominican Republic.Shilpa Jhobalia - Producer of The Lonely HimalayasShilpa Jhobalia - Producerof The Lonely Himalayas and formervolunteer at the Himalayan Ethno BotanicGarden Society.  She is a LicensedProfessional Counselor by the State of Illinois and has counseled youth andfamilies in areas of depression, anxiety, and ADHD.  She formerly served as a US Peace CorpsVolunteer in the Dominican Republic (2008-2010) in the Youth, Family, andCommunity Development sector.  In thePeace Corps, Shilpa formed the BrigadaVerde, an environmental youth group to implement a variety of environmentaleducation programs and activities.  Shealso worked with community leaders to develop a community library for thevillage of Las Delicias.  Shilpa earned aMaster’s degree in Community Counseling from Argosy University-Schaumburg, as well as a Bachelor’sdegree in Psychology from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.Pankaj Bhakuni - Director of the Lonely HimalayasPankaj Bhakuni  - Director of The Lonely Himalayas and Secretary of the Himalayan Ethno Botanic Garden Society (HEBGS).

Shachindra spent approximately15 years in Delhi and Bombay as a video editor editing documentary films for CARE, Water Aid,Human Rights Law Network, Help Age-South-East Asia and the Indian Institute of FineArts.  He also has experience editing television commercials for innumerable brands. After leaving thecity life, he co-founded the HimalayanEthno Botanic Garden Society  with colleague,Pankaj Bhakuni. He set up a media center in Basouli and introduced the villageyouth to audio visual technology through media workshops. He is also activelyinvolved in setting up of HEBGS’ ecotourism campsite, Camp Junaili, and plans to organize outdoor trainingworkshops by professionals to generate employment opportunities for the villageyouth.Every worthwhile experience will have obstacles to hurdle.  While it is difficult to anticipate what these obstacles will be, we are committed to overcoming them.  Production delays are a slight possibility, given the sporadic electricity and internet in Binsar Valley, especially during winter and monsoon seasons.  However, this is unlikely to throw off the progress of this film more than a few weeks, as most editing will be done from larger cities nearby with more reliable infrastructure.  Perhaps the largest obstacle we will face is the lack of film financing, which will ensure this film will not be made, which is why we’re launching this Kickstarter initiative!  Luckily, Kickstarter has a forum for us to communicate with our contributors for any updates.  We plan to utilize this forum to maintain an open line of communication with all our contributors.  Collaborator mishaps may occur, although all members of The Lonely Himalayas crew are committed to the production of this film.  The inception of this film grew through the spirit of volunteerism and love for nature."
Phrenic's Interactive Comic & Alternate Reality Game|failed|"Do you ever wish you could communicate with comic book characters in real life? We're hoping create Phrenic Clone Assassin, an interactive comic enhanced with alternate reality games that lets you communicate directly with characters over email, text messages, phone calls, and Twitter. One of the actors in Phrenic, Steve Mattsson, used to write comics for DC, Marvel, and Dark Horse. He contacted his friend, the legendary comic artist Paul Gulacy about drawing Phrenic Clone Assassin. Paul has drawn The Dark Knight, Wolverine, Black Widow, Catwoman, and many more. So this comic is part of a short film too?Yes, here's a preview of one of the clone assassinations...Will there be a print version of the comic?It's possible to get a ""ashcan print"" version by supporting our campaign (see the Ashcan Print perk). You can also get an autographed print of the cover.Ashcan Comics are the rarest of the rare for comic book collectors.Maybe you'd like an autographed cover, sort of like this one....One of our perks is a 11x17 print that will be autographed by DC/Marvel legend Paul GulacyWhy is there a cover if the comic hasn't been made?We commissioned the cover to be drawn and colored in order to show the quality we expect the final comic to have. We even had a photoshoot! Paul Gulacy drew the cover and it was colored by Grace Allison--both did amazing!Paul Gulacy takes a reference photo of Kirsten Foe and Steve MattssonWhat are alternate reality games?We created an ARG for this Kickstarter. You can interact with Anya, the Clone Assassin, by texting ""I need your services"" to her phone: 971-717-2850 or tweeting to her at @ikillclones (we don't do anything with your number other than let Anya reply to you).There are different types of alternate reality games (ARGs). Phrenic is planning an ARG designed to blur the line between the comic and reality. You'll be communicating with the characters and getting new pieces of the story through these interactions. Two examples of ARGs we've done already for Phrenic include: @PhrenicDoll Tweet Your Own Adventure and the Life Identical Genetic Enhancement Screening. Zoe Trapp screens you for genetic enhancements over video chat (then tells you what's REALLY going on over personalized emails and videos).Will the clues in the final comic be as obvious as the ones in this campaign?The clues we're planning for the Clone Assassin comic will be woven into the story to be discovered by curious and attentive readers. There won't be prompts announcing what to do like there is in this campaign.What are the stories and movies mentioned in the rewards?We've already filmed one episode of the clone assassin killing four of the twelve clones. There is also a complete short story featuring Anya that provides hints about her past and how she got involved killing clones.Frank Taylor (Steve Mattsson) aims a gun in the Clone Assassin episodeAnya (Kirsten Foe) in the Clone Assassin episodePhrenic cards and a pin. We've already got four character cards and plan four more as rewards. Maybe they'll have ARGs too? (Photo by @argmuseum)Is it possible to just read the comic without texting and emailing?Yes! The final comic will tell an entire story on its own. The interactive elements enhance the story and characters, but you are not required to interact in order to read the main plot and ending. Interact with the clone assassin over phone calls, text messages, email, or Twitter. (It will be more fun, we promise.)Where will your donation go?In order to make this interactive comic a reality, we need to pay artists and colorists, web developers and transmedia storytellers. There are also hard costs tied to the services that make communicating with fictional characters a reality.Phrenic Clone Assassin cover colored by Grace AllisonHow do I donate and pledge support?Just click the green “Back This Project” button in the upper right-hand corner. You will be asked to enter your amount and select a reward. From there, you will go through the Amazon checkout process. You must finish the Amazon checkout process for your pledge to be recorded. Then, spread the word about the Phrenic Clone Assassin interactive comic on Facebook and Twitter. Help us find other people who love interactive comics and alternate reality games! Tell them they can help get this cool new project made! Every little bit truly helps. With your generosity, I believe we can do it. Stay Involved! We need your help to spread the word!Is funding really all or nothing?Yes it is! Every Kickstarter project must be fully funded before its time expires or NO MONEY CHANGES HANDS. And it is a great way for us to discover if there is true support for this comic before we begin drawing a single panel. If we don't make our goal, we don't get to make the Phrenic Clone Assassin comic.OFFICIAL SITE FOR PHRENIC: http://phrenicworld.comPHRENIC iOS APP: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id573340275?mt=8PAUL GULACY (Artist): http://gulacy.comGRACE ALLISON (Colorist): http://gracifer.com/Original cover artwork by Paul GulacyThis project relies on expertise from a variety of creative fields: writing, drawing, coloring, filmmaking, coding. Not to mention managing technical infrastructure that allows the clone assassin to receive and reply to a variety of messages. This is an ambitious project and honestly a lot could go wrong. But if you're familiar with Phrenic, you know we tirelessly pursue our creative goals and always find a way around or through technical obstacles. We want to create a brand new type of comic experience and, if we're fully funded, we're confident nothing can stop us from doing just that.Our backers are our priority.

Carnival Arts Exhibit at Miami International Airport|successful|Carnival Arts Exhibit at Miami International Airport The Carnival Arts crew is putting on a major exhibit that will be seen by thousands of people in an art gallery at the Miami International Airport. To do this, we need to prepare for exhibit dozens of masks, costumes, and videos we've made over the past six years. We are also creating new work to hang from the high ceiling above the exhibit: 10 new 12-foot banners featuring 10 different carnival traditions and 3 GIANT carnival costumes. Carnival Arts Workshop 2008What is Carnival Arts?: For the past six years, dozens of Miami's best artists have collaborated with teens at the Miami Bridge youth crisis shelter. Through a series of ongoing workshops, these young artists learn traditional carnival arts of dancing, drumming, and maskmaking. They've put on dozens of performances from 10 carnival traditoins, created hundreds of masks, and even produced two short, Caribbean-themed films. Now it's time to share this work with the world -- or at least thousands of passengers in the Miami International Airport -- in a major exhibit with some major new pieces. Setting a plaster cast on a young artistWhy Carnival Arts? Carnival in the Caribbean and Latin America is a time of celebration. That’s in spite of the violent history of these beautiful lands beginning with slavery and colonialism right up to political upheaval and poverty today. Carnival is a way of celebrating life in a time of crisis. That’s why Carnival Artists collaborate with young people at the Miami Bridge youth crisis shelter. In the carnival tradition, these young artists make masks and costumes that at once hide their identity and reveal how they feel about themselves and their world. They learn dance and drumming styles associated with different countries, from Cuba, Trinidad, and Haiti to Brazil, Colombia and Peru. Over the past six years, dozens of artists have taught elements of these traditions to hundreds of youth in crisis. Together, we’ve even made two films with stories taken from Caribbean history and Carnival lore. Now we will share this work with thousands of travelers passing through the Miami International Airport in February, March, and April.mia galleries at Miami International Airport: The Miami International Airport has one of the richest arts programs of any airport in the United States. The airport is home to dozens of permanent works of public art, as well as five galleries that showcase fine arts. The Carnival Arts exhibit will be held in the South Terminal Gallery, which is typically reserved for handcrafts from around the world – such as women’s basketweaving  in Rwanda and Brazilian design projects using recycled materials. The South Terminal Gallery holds six glass cases for exhibiting the masks, three large walls for photographs, video, and text, a large platform that will hold mannequins with costumes, and five overhead hangers for brand new banners and three giant carnival costumes. Giant Costumes!Carnival Artist poses with our first bannerWhy We Need Your $$: We need your money to buy and build special materials for mounting masks and displaying costumes. We need your money to create the hanging banners and giant carnival costumes that will hang above the exhibit. We need your money to transform the platform in the exhibit space into a carroza, a carnival float, like the elaborate floats used in carnival parades in Barranquilla, Colombia. Last, but not least, we need your money to pay for dancing and drumming workshops for the teens in the shelter right now so that they will be able to perform at the exhibit's opening and closing receptions.Thank you so much for helping Carnival Artists share their work with the world!Materials for a maskmaking workshopThe Carnival Arts exhibit at mia galleries has a firm deadline: the show must be up by February 7 and down soon after April 14. Otherwise, we miss or chance. And mia galleries has a big empty gallery for two months. That can't happen!We have lots of volunteers ready to help build the materials and mount the exhibit. We have a wonderful group of professional artists ready to collaborate with the young artists in the shelter to make the new, giant elements for the exhibit. We can make this happen. We've had plenty of mishaps over the past six years -- as you can imagine: All of our young artists are already in the midst of a terrible crisis! But with your help, we will overcome them all. That's what Carnival Arts is all about: celebrating life in a time of crisis.

Just some of the customization factors you can change are: hair, hair color, skin tone, height, body weight, body tone, and eye color.3. Leveling System / Skill System / Enhancement SystemThe leveling system is complimented with a excellent skill based system, allowing for a large variety of playstyles. Now you add in our skill based system, every level you can pick from skills that progress as you progress in the game. Some examples are: acrobatics, alchemist, blacksmith, cook, engineer, taming, healer, tailor, trapper, scribe, and stealth. But wait there's more! The enhancement system builds on our skill system as a whole. You can pick from a large list of enhancements, which makes abilities, skills, spells, and even crafting more effective.4. Combat StructureThe combat system brings in a dynamic of skill based combat, from a first or third person perspective. We decided to stay away from auto-attacking systems, instead allowing you to take control of your character. You tell your character where it's going to attack, and when it's going to attack. Abilities and spells have to be aimed to connect with the target, however the target could dodge if you forget to lead them, however so can you! There is also mounted combat, sea battles, and more!5. Looting SystemYou can loot almost anything in the world if you want to. No equipment is bound to you, everything you find or loot can be sold to other players or taken by other players. What we're trying to say is if another player waits for you to die, they can loot everything that you have on your character, well if they can carry it of course.6. Housing SystemYes we know, games are starting to have housing systems all over the place. But do they have our system! You can build a house anywhere in the world, well if you can find space to fit the home of your dreams. You can build each wall, window, door, stairs, roof, and even a garden if you so wish. You can make a small hut or a massive guild hall!7. Vendor SystemWe don't use auction house systems for players to purchases all huddled in one building. Our system allows players to place a NPC in there houses, guild halls, or even in major cities to sell whatever you craft or find exploring the world. You set the price and compete against other players in the world. You can even place a NPC in your house or guild hall, and rent them out to other players for a small fee. So even if you don't want to craft or sell what you find to make a profit, you can make money on other players doing so from your amazing location in the world! Daggermond Structure1.

However the players will not feel the difference in server hopes as it will be a fluid transition that's constantly happening.We plan to bring on a larger team depending on size of interest we receive from the community as a whole from all sources. This will give us a ""rough"" head count so we can plan for having quality work and a responsible pace, while also having great customer service.Our number one goal is customer satisfaction, we put it as a risk or challenge as catering to every customers needs can be difficult. We want to make a game for all gamer's to enjoy, which we realize is a hard market to hit. We're going to hold monthly open sessions with the development team and our customers to help us level out and create a perfect game that gamer's will come to love and enjoy for years to come."
Choose Your Fate - The film that puts YOU in charge|failed|"Are you tired of just ""watching"" movies? Do you want to control what happens? Well JABB pictures is putting you in charge. JABB pictures is seeking funding for their first feature length film Choose Your Fate. Choose Your Fate is a revolutionary new take on filmmaking. For the first time, the viewer will decide the fate of the characters onscreen. By using your dvd player remote, you will be responsible for making decisions for the characters in the film. You decide if the character runs and hides or stays and fights. Once you have made your decision you must now watch idly as the character deals with the consequences.The films plot is based around a young woman who finds herself trapped in an abandoned hospital unaware of the circumstances that brought her there. As she searches the hospital for a way out she encounters situations where you the viewer must decide her fate. Will she go investigate that sound? Will she help the person in need? Each choice has a different outcome. The decisions you make along the way will determine the ultimate path of the film, and in the end, the fate of the young woman. Will your decisions lead her to safety or her brutal death?The film will be set in the Art Deco inspired 4 story former home of the Indiana home for feeble minded boys in Butlerville, IN. I have scouted this location and have confirmation from it's owner to use it for filming. This facility is fully set with authentic medical equipment and is an ideal location for this film. We have a completed script for the film and will begin casting once funding is secured. Jason Hoover will be the writer, director, director of photography, camera operator, editor and music supervisor. Jason is the owner of JABB pictures and has written, directed and produced two short films to date, Spike (2009) and ""POLLY"" (2010). Both films have received overwhelmingly positive reviews from the leading reviewers in the horror genre. Jason Schneeberger of Horrorhound Magazine writes ""Spike is a welcome surprise from first time director Jason Hoover and Jabb pictures. Hoover has created a highly captivating and compelling short film that has introduced his company with a resounding bang."" Having successfully completed two short films, JABB pictures is ready to take on the challenge of a full length feature film.JABB pictures has made a name for itself by creating high quality films with very limited resources. This film will be no different. Every dollar you donate will be spent very wisely. JABB pictures needs to raise $3,500.00 to complete this film. That's a huge number to most of us but for a high quality feature length film it's extremely low. All donations will go to the purchase of a tripod suitable for filming, preproduction meetings, travel costs for the production staff and actors/actresses, DV tapes for recording, food, make up and special effects, props, costumes and a few Starbucks frappuccino's for the late nights we will spend editing. JABB pictures has so far funded all their own projects but without your help the completion of a full length feature is out of our reach. Help us fulfill our dream!Teaser trailer coming soon!"

Dos Pueblos Tecnicos|successful|The Dos Pueblos Tecnicos is the Dos Pueblos High School Chapter of the United States Institute of Theatre Technology (USITT).We are future professionals dedicated to providing technical support, partnerships, and student apprentices to various local theatre companies and performance and visual arts organizations while developing our own professional presence in a safe space through resume building, portfolio workshops and presentations, as well as professional mock interviews.With the money we raise from our Kickstarter, we plan to pay our initial start up costs, which include membership dues to the national organization.  We will also begin to invest in field trips like a backstage tour of Disneyland, a theatre college tour for our seniors, and the national USITT conference in Ohio this Spring.We have the potential to become an awesome organization dedicated to community support, but we can only do it with your help.After our initial start up, we will continue to need sources of funding for producing events and shows and paying for the many field trips we're planning.  While many of these expenses may be paid for by the students involved, we're hoping to host events to subsidize these costs and it is possible we will be unable to raise the necessary ongoing funds.In the event we are unable to support field trips and internal functions, we will continue to reach out externally through community service projects and doing what we can to support local theatre companies.

SINS - The Roleplaying Game|successful|"At its heart, SINS is a narrative role-playing game,specifically focused on telling the stories of powerfulentities known as Nemissaries - reborn individuals back from the dead with a wealth of mysterious powers, who have risen once more to fight an eldritch hive-mind of the undying, known as the Brood, in the post-apocalyptic ruins of a 22nd Century Earth.For all its high-octane combat and supernatural forces, SINS is a cinematic game about choice, morality and the consequences which come from wielding great and terrible power in a world desperate for heroes and leaders. It’s also about embarking on life-changing adventures, battling supernatural horrors, and often, simply surviving life in an unforgiving world fraught with danger, where even the Nemissaries’ great powers won’t necessarily protect them.SINS RPG Stretch GoalsSINS Distribution for the US is supported by BackerKit SINS is a Friendly-Shipping Project - No Duties to the US or EU. Sins is all at once an exciting, mysterious and terrifying game which crosses several genres, and contains a rich mythos with a great deal to explore and inspire the imagination, all whilst taking familiar genres that you know and love into creative new ground.A Dying World  Sins takes place in our own world, albeitabout a century from now. The world as we know it isgone, replaced with a bleak post-apocalyptic wilderness.Some areas of the world have been scorched by nuclearweapons, and others have returned to their natural state,but the one constant is that mankind is no longer themaster of the world.Large nations or civilisations are rare, and most contacttakes place primarily on a local level between nomadicgroups and small settlements. There are exceptionshowever, and one of the core themes of the game is there-emergence of civilisations.A Monstrous Enemy  A major aspect of the setting are the aforementioned Brood, which are best described asa vast horde of highly mobile animated dead whoshare a dim collective consciousness and have thecapacity to evolve into more dangerous, specialised forms.It’s a mistake to view the Brood simply as the walkingdead, because as their numbers grow, they begin to hear astrange, unearthly call, which lends a frightening degree of regenerative endurance and cunningcoordination to their actions.  Forgotten Horrors A major part of the world’s history,and one of the reasons for the dramatic fall of civilisation was theemergence of seven individual beings with almost god-likedestructive capabilities and the capacity to control theBrood. These creatures, now most commonly knownas the Reapers, slaughtered their way through the largestconcentrations of military might, and personally took ahand in the murder of many of the world’s leaders.At the height of their reign of terror, their victory seemedcertain, but after a succession of surprising setbacks,including the death of one of their number in China,they seemed to disappear utterly. The Reapers nowrepresent one of many unsolved mysteries for playersto potentially stumble upon.Dark Heroes  The beings which players portray were originally individuals consumed by the Brood, who fought back against their Hive-mind to retain a sense of self-awareness, and as such, regained their human forms and consciousness. Striking out against the Brood, they became known as the Nemissaries, after the ancient Greek goddess of retribution.In a way, the Nemissaries sum up everything about thesetting. They are at once monstrous, forced to survive asparasites, feeding on human emotion, but also incrediblypowerful, capable of leading the way into a new future,and even opposing the Reapers, should they re-emerge.Nemissaries have many powers at their disposal – notleast of which are the five primal Songs granting control over Blood, Bone,Flesh, Will, and the Brood. Collectively, these Songs of eldritch power, alongwith their impressive physical abilities, allow Nemissariesto overcome almost any opposition, particularly when theychoose to work together.Nemissaries have a dark side as well, however – a strangewound in their soul, perhaps a side effect from theirrebirth, or the lingering power of the Brood. In anycase, every Nemissary contains their own worst enemy, and greatest weapon, inside of them - The Hollow. A demonic alter-ego ofeverything a Nemissary hates about themselves, the Hollow is an internal monster thatjust wants to watch the world burn.The JudgesThe downfall of the 21st Century began with aphenomenon known as the Black Rain, where a greatnumber of crystalline objects, most roughly the size ofcars, but many much smaller, fell to Earth. These objectshave now come to be known as the Shards, and representone of the deepest mysteries of the 22nd Century. On the onehand, most of the Shards seem to repel the Brood, buton the other, they often also have a damaging effect onthe human psyche, forcing people to relive the mistakesof their lives, sometimes driving them to insanity or death.Some of the Shards are also known to be more positive,offering a strange sort of oasis in the wastelands of theworld, free from the Brood. It has also become commonknowledge that the tiny fragments of the Shards – alsoknown as Voidglass – are extremely damaging to the Brood.The Shards themselves are also capable of communication,often giving out cryptic advice to the Nemissaries,along with spiritual guidance, but anyone who spendsprolonged time communing with one will soon beginto suspect that the Shards know far more than they arewilling to tell...Great Conspiracies We’ve mentioned that in the world of Sins, civilisation as we know it has fallen. The existence of the Nemissaries has offered new hope, but also brought about new conflicts and pain. Across the world, new powers are emerging.  Some extol the nearly-forgotten virtues of Democracy and Freedom. Others are authoritarian dictatorships. Behind it all however, are the influences of the First-born – the eldest of the Nemissaries – who have begun to use their powers to build their own visions of the future. The Nemissaries themselves, along with mankind as a whole, have often fallen in with the factions these powerful individuals have woven about themselves. Their gathered followers preach their ideals and cooperate with one another, rebuilding human civilisation but also setting the stage for the horrifying conflicts to come.Hope and DespairThe world of SINS is bleak,and even considering everything we’ve just mentioned, itgets worse. The Brood is not defeated, the factions of theNemissaries are at each other's throats, and the Reapersare still out there somewhere, licking their wounds. Worsestill, powers long asleep have begun to take an interest inthe mortal world for the first time in millennia.The truth is though, is that SINS is really about hope. Thecharacters you play, for the most part, are those individualswho want to change the world for the better. They arepeople who aren’t content to let their loved ones die, or tobe the pawns of mad gods. They mean to make the world a better place, or die in the attempt. This is the choiceeach player will make – the choice each character mustmake – to stand and fight when the dawn seems furthest,or to just be one more collaborator in mankind’s demise. Caught Your Interest?Great! This is a 357 page, full colour, Core Rulebook, complete with everything needed to play and stunning artwork throughout, all by Will Kirkby (Grenade, Wraithking, Tuk Tuk,and featured in Image Comics, Oni Press, and the upcoming Critical Role Artbook)Our plans are for at least another 3 further major expansions which will be released over the next 3 years, along with smaller, intermittent supplements supporting the game's longevity and an active social media presence that provides weekly lore updates and free, supplemental scenarios and game prompts. In other words, once SINS is out, we'll constantly have new content for players to explore - handy for those busy weeks where the GM might not have had time to prepare!SINS runs on its own unique engine, the HOPE engine, based on Degrees of Success from small, attribute-based D6 dice pools that average 7 die and never exceed 10 die, even at the top levels of play.Players gain Successes determined by Skill Ratings, and compare their results against target numbers to gauge if they've scored a Success or not.The GM sets the amount of Successes required to pass an Action, and any more Successes than required become outcome, a unique system that allows for epic, cinematic and co-operative actions. The game boasts over 100 unique powers, known as Arietta, and over 75 Skills, Traits and Qualities with which to affect both mechanics and narrative, supported in play with an easy to read, single-page character sheet.Another integral part of the SINS system is the lack of a conventional levelling system. Instead, characters take narrative-based paths towards their goals with Motivations, and as they work towards them, they gain Achievement Points. These in turn can be used to mechanically increase a character's stats, skills and abilities in the more traditional sense.Characters can also call on Motivations they believe to be important to the Session or events in play, and receive appropriated bonuses as a result. We believe this integral combination of narrative and mechanics right at the heart of the system is the perfect balance of progression and achievement, and defines SINS as a truly narrative-driven roleplaying game. The SINS system, and in turn the HOPE engine, have now been play-tested by hundreds, including both private groups with varied experience levels, and by open display groups at the 2017 UK Games expo, each to overwhelmingly positive feedback. As with any Kickstarter, the amount you choose to pledge will reflect the products and extras you receive. As both avid Kickstarter backers and Roleplayers ourselves, we understand that too much choice and not enough budget can be overwhelming! To that end, we're keeping our tiers simple, affordable - and we believe - worth every cent & penny pledged.We also offer a tailored pledge tier exclusively for Brick & Mortar store owners and independent retailers looking to stock SINS, allowing us to bring the game to as wide of an audience as possible, all whilst supporting the local gaming stores that make this RPGs and the tabletop industry possible.The world as we know it is gone, and the undying horde are countless.

It was bounced around amid all the other creative ideas he keeps in there for long enough for it to grow to maturity. From time to time he would bring it out to the table to play in one form or another and then put it back and let it grow some more.   It might have stayed a hidden from the world at large if not for a post-game conversation with his local game store owner that moved onto  the topic of how there was now enough of SINS in Miquel’s head to fill a book. It’s a little known secret that games store owners are generally very enthusiastic about games and are often very good at sharing that enthusiasm.  Some enthusiasm for the idea became the encouragement to take things a step further. And the project to make SINS - the RPG began. One of the really nice things about this book and this project as a whole is the way the game was developed and refined through a network of eager and talented people that all frequent that very same games store. In fact everything from play-testing to proof reading, artwork to layout was done by people, amateur enthusiasts and professionals both - from that very same gaming community. Even the making and printing of the GM Screens has been done by a printer that is a regular to our local gaming store!Another little known secret about games store owners is that they can be very, very patient people and even though this project has been in development for almost 5 years  now, with a lot of ups and downs and some major shifts in both the industry and the RPG market, there has always been members of the team carrying the torch and keeping an eye on the light at the end of the tunnel.SINS, like many tabletop RPGs, began life as a simple collection of ideas around a kitchen table many years ago. Since then, it has grown into a fully fledged book, and proof-read copies have graced many darkened kitchen tables and game rooms up and down the UK in the last few years. After all this time of tweaking and revision, we believe now is the time to bring the franchise into the wider market, and utilise this Kickstarter to establish ourselves as a small start-up team with a wealth of ideas just waiting to be realised.Ultimately, we're really all just about having great games with friends. SINSwas born from that very act.  It is the sum of a lot of influences poured into a great big melting-pot and stirred thoroughly with the spoon of enthusiasm and left to simmer until it was good and ready.Back in 2014 when we showed SINS to some people over at Chronicle City one of them said of it;“it wears its influences on its sleeve” and we believe that it truly does just that.  At its heart, Sins is a game that pays influential tributes to lots of things that we love, and all of it served up with a little of our own seasoning. We hope you get to enjoy it as much as we have.- The SINS TeamAll this looks pretty complete... Why Kickstarter? Our Ultimate Goal - is simply to get a book that we love out there and available to gaming groups and to as many people as possible, and we believe that Kickstarter is the best medium to do this as the SINS Project establishes itself in the industry.Alongside that, we also value the support of 'Brick and Mortar' stores, who we recognise as being integral in the growth of any roleplaying product and vital to the communal spread of tabletop games. Through Kickstarter's tiered pledge system, we can offer Brick and Mortar stores varying degrees of support for our game in a way that benefits both us, them, and most importantly, players! Stores that back our Retailer pledge - will be provided with unique covers, rewards and accessories directly from us, providing the much-needed extra support that allow stores to demo and run games without eating into their profits.SINS is hoped to be the first of many high-quality tabletop games in our planned repertoire that interact and evolve alongside both their playerbase and the commercial market, and if our feedback from the UK Games Expo is anything to go by, we believe it demonstrates our ability to deliver premium, professional-standard games straight from humble beginnings, all whilst doing service to the local gaming stores that made this project possible in the first place.I'm really into all this, where are all the stretch goal goodies & accessories?We could, can, and have created a whole bunch!And these are only proofs, with a whole lot more planned and in development to support our game. But the truth to their availability is that we believe the livelihood of a game is in the quality, and the availability, of its core rulebook - and how many people can get to enjoy it. There's nothing worse than hearing about a cool Kickstarter RPG, only to find out their initial print-run is over and that you have to wait to get to play it...To that end, we're only focusing on getting out core rulebooks - as soon as we possibly can. They're finished, so there's no reason not to! The more orders we receive for the core rulebook, the quicker you and your players can get it to your gaming table.  No fuss, no frills, and certainly no delays or waiting around on accessories and extras yet to come.

CAKEHOUSE :Layer Studios Comics Zine.|successful|"At its heart, SINS is a narrative role-playing game,specifically focused on telling the stories of powerfulentities known as Nemissaries - reborn individuals back from the dead with a wealth of mysterious powers, who have risen once more to fight an eldritch hive-mind of the undying, known as the Brood, in the post-apocalyptic ruins of a 22nd Century Earth.For all its high-octane combat and supernatural forces, SINS is a cinematic game about choice, morality and the consequences which come from wielding great and terrible power in a world desperate for heroes and leaders. It’s also about embarking on life-changing adventures, battling supernatural horrors, and often, simply surviving life in an unforgiving world fraught with danger, where even the Nemissaries’ great powers won’t necessarily protect them.SINS RPG Stretch GoalsSINS Distribution for the US is supported by BackerKit SINS is a Friendly-Shipping Project - No Duties to the US or EU. Sins is all at once an exciting, mysterious and terrifying game which crosses several genres, and contains a rich mythos with a great deal to explore and inspire the imagination, all whilst taking familiar genres that you know and love into creative new ground.A Dying World  Sins takes place in our own world, albeitabout a century from now. The world as we know it isgone, replaced with a bleak post-apocalyptic wilderness.Some areas of the world have been scorched by nuclearweapons, and others have returned to their natural state,but the one constant is that mankind is no longer themaster of the world.Large nations or civilisations are rare, and most contacttakes place primarily on a local level between nomadicgroups and small settlements. There are exceptionshowever, and one of the core themes of the game is there-emergence of civilisations.A Monstrous Enemy  A major aspect of the setting are the aforementioned Brood, which are best described asa vast horde of highly mobile animated dead whoshare a dim collective consciousness and have thecapacity to evolve into more dangerous, specialised forms.It’s a mistake to view the Brood simply as the walkingdead, because as their numbers grow, they begin to hear astrange, unearthly call, which lends a frightening degree of regenerative endurance and cunningcoordination to their actions.  Forgotten Horrors A major part of the world’s history,and one of the reasons for the dramatic fall of civilisation was theemergence of seven individual beings with almost god-likedestructive capabilities and the capacity to control theBrood. These creatures, now most commonly knownas the Reapers, slaughtered their way through the largestconcentrations of military might, and personally took ahand in the murder of many of the world’s leaders.At the height of their reign of terror, their victory seemedcertain, but after a succession of surprising setbacks,including the death of one of their number in China,they seemed to disappear utterly. The Reapers nowrepresent one of many unsolved mysteries for playersto potentially stumble upon.Dark Heroes  The beings which players portray were originally individuals consumed by the Brood, who fought back against their Hive-mind to retain a sense of self-awareness, and as such, regained their human forms and consciousness. Striking out against the Brood, they became known as the Nemissaries, after the ancient Greek goddess of retribution.In a way, the Nemissaries sum up everything about thesetting. They are at once monstrous, forced to survive asparasites, feeding on human emotion, but also incrediblypowerful, capable of leading the way into a new future,and even opposing the Reapers, should they re-emerge.Nemissaries have many powers at their disposal – notleast of which are the five primal Songs granting control over Blood, Bone,Flesh, Will, and the Brood. Collectively, these Songs of eldritch power, alongwith their impressive physical abilities, allow Nemissariesto overcome almost any opposition, particularly when theychoose to work together.Nemissaries have a dark side as well, however – a strangewound in their soul, perhaps a side effect from theirrebirth, or the lingering power of the Brood. In anycase, every Nemissary contains their own worst enemy, and greatest weapon, inside of them - The Hollow. A demonic alter-ego ofeverything a Nemissary hates about themselves, the Hollow is an internal monster thatjust wants to watch the world burn.The JudgesThe downfall of the 21st Century began with aphenomenon known as the Black Rain, where a greatnumber of crystalline objects, most roughly the size ofcars, but many much smaller, fell to Earth. These objectshave now come to be known as the Shards, and representone of the deepest mysteries of the 22nd Century. On the onehand, most of the Shards seem to repel the Brood, buton the other, they often also have a damaging effect onthe human psyche, forcing people to relive the mistakesof their lives, sometimes driving them to insanity or death.Some of the Shards are also known to be more positive,offering a strange sort of oasis in the wastelands of theworld, free from the Brood. It has also become commonknowledge that the tiny fragments of the Shards – alsoknown as Voidglass – are extremely damaging to the Brood.The Shards themselves are also capable of communication,often giving out cryptic advice to the Nemissaries,along with spiritual guidance, but anyone who spendsprolonged time communing with one will soon beginto suspect that the Shards know far more than they arewilling to tell...Great Conspiracies We’ve mentioned that in the world of Sins, civilisation as we know it has fallen. The existence of the Nemissaries has offered new hope, but also brought about new conflicts and pain. Across the world, new powers are emerging.  Some extol the nearly-forgotten virtues of Democracy and Freedom. Others are authoritarian dictatorships. Behind it all however, are the influences of the First-born – the eldest of the Nemissaries – who have begun to use their powers to build their own visions of the future. The Nemissaries themselves, along with mankind as a whole, have often fallen in with the factions these powerful individuals have woven about themselves. Their gathered followers preach their ideals and cooperate with one another, rebuilding human civilisation but also setting the stage for the horrifying conflicts to come.Hope and DespairThe world of SINS is bleak,and even considering everything we’ve just mentioned, itgets worse. The Brood is not defeated, the factions of theNemissaries are at each other's throats, and the Reapersare still out there somewhere, licking their wounds. Worsestill, powers long asleep have begun to take an interest inthe mortal world for the first time in millennia.The truth is though, is that SINS is really about hope. Thecharacters you play, for the most part, are those individualswho want to change the world for the better. They arepeople who aren’t content to let their loved ones die, or tobe the pawns of mad gods. They mean to make the world a better place, or die in the attempt. This is the choiceeach player will make – the choice each character mustmake – to stand and fight when the dawn seems furthest,or to just be one more collaborator in mankind’s demise. Caught Your Interest?Great! This is a 357 page, full colour, Core Rulebook, complete with everything needed to play and stunning artwork throughout, all by Will Kirkby (Grenade, Wraithking, Tuk Tuk,and featured in Image Comics, Oni Press, and the upcoming Critical Role Artbook)Our plans are for at least another 3 further major expansions which will be released over the next 3 years, along with smaller, intermittent supplements supporting the game's longevity and an active social media presence that provides weekly lore updates and free, supplemental scenarios and game prompts. In other words, once SINS is out, we'll constantly have new content for players to explore - handy for those busy weeks where the GM might not have had time to prepare!SINS runs on its own unique engine, the HOPE engine, based on Degrees of Success from small, attribute-based D6 dice pools that average 7 die and never exceed 10 die, even at the top levels of play.Players gain Successes determined by Skill Ratings, and compare their results against target numbers to gauge if they've scored a Success or not.The GM sets the amount of Successes required to pass an Action, and any more Successes than required become outcome, a unique system that allows for epic, cinematic and co-operative actions. The game boasts over 100 unique powers, known as Arietta, and over 75 Skills, Traits and Qualities with which to affect both mechanics and narrative, supported in play with an easy to read, single-page character sheet.Another integral part of the SINS system is the lack of a conventional levelling system. Instead, characters take narrative-based paths towards their goals with Motivations, and as they work towards them, they gain Achievement Points. These in turn can be used to mechanically increase a character's stats, skills and abilities in the more traditional sense.Characters can also call on Motivations they believe to be important to the Session or events in play, and receive appropriated bonuses as a result. We believe this integral combination of narrative and mechanics right at the heart of the system is the perfect balance of progression and achievement, and defines SINS as a truly narrative-driven roleplaying game. The SINS system, and in turn the HOPE engine, have now been play-tested by hundreds, including both private groups with varied experience levels, and by open display groups at the 2017 UK Games expo, each to overwhelmingly positive feedback. As with any Kickstarter, the amount you choose to pledge will reflect the products and extras you receive. As both avid Kickstarter backers and Roleplayers ourselves, we understand that too much choice and not enough budget can be overwhelming! To that end, we're keeping our tiers simple, affordable - and we believe - worth every cent & penny pledged.We also offer a tailored pledge tier exclusively for Brick & Mortar store owners and independent retailers looking to stock SINS, allowing us to bring the game to as wide of an audience as possible, all whilst supporting the local gaming stores that make this RPGs and the tabletop industry possible.The world as we know it is gone, and the undying horde are countless.

It was bounced around amid all the other creative ideas he keeps in there for long enough for it to grow to maturity. From time to time he would bring it out to the table to play in one form or another and then put it back and let it grow some more.   It might have stayed a hidden from the world at large if not for a post-game conversation with his local game store owner that moved onto  the topic of how there was now enough of SINS in Miquel’s head to fill a book. It’s a little known secret that games store owners are generally very enthusiastic about games and are often very good at sharing that enthusiasm.  Some enthusiasm for the idea became the encouragement to take things a step further. And the project to make SINS - the RPG began. One of the really nice things about this book and this project as a whole is the way the game was developed and refined through a network of eager and talented people that all frequent that very same games store. In fact everything from play-testing to proof reading, artwork to layout was done by people, amateur enthusiasts and professionals both - from that very same gaming community. Even the making and printing of the GM Screens has been done by a printer that is a regular to our local gaming store!Another little known secret about games store owners is that they can be very, very patient people and even though this project has been in development for almost 5 years  now, with a lot of ups and downs and some major shifts in both the industry and the RPG market, there has always been members of the team carrying the torch and keeping an eye on the light at the end of the tunnel.SINS, like many tabletop RPGs, began life as a simple collection of ideas around a kitchen table many years ago. Since then, it has grown into a fully fledged book, and proof-read copies have graced many darkened kitchen tables and game rooms up and down the UK in the last few years. After all this time of tweaking and revision, we believe now is the time to bring the franchise into the wider market, and utilise this Kickstarter to establish ourselves as a small start-up team with a wealth of ideas just waiting to be realised.Ultimately, we're really all just about having great games with friends. SINSwas born from that very act.  It is the sum of a lot of influences poured into a great big melting-pot and stirred thoroughly with the spoon of enthusiasm and left to simmer until it was good and ready.Back in 2014 when we showed SINS to some people over at Chronicle City one of them said of it;“it wears its influences on its sleeve” and we believe that it truly does just that.  At its heart, Sins is a game that pays influential tributes to lots of things that we love, and all of it served up with a little of our own seasoning. We hope you get to enjoy it as much as we have.- The SINS TeamAll this looks pretty complete...

1of10: T-Shirt To Protest Trump / Putin Connection|failed|I'm Mad as Hell and I Won't Be Silent!We live in perilous times. Not only is our president incompetent, he is... Oh, never mind! No point launching into a diatribe. But if you are happy with Donald Trump and his policies, this might not be the page for you. However, if you, like me, are angry or alarmed, you might like this campaign.The goal of this project is to create at least a dozen t-shirts which protest Donald Trump's connection with Vladimir Putin.We all know that Putin manipulated our election process to favor Trump and understandably, Trump is indebted to Putin. I don't know what kind of deal. Putin and Trump worked out, but I am sure that if it is good for Putin, it is probably bad for America. I won't stand by and become stunned into  acquiescence by such despicable behavior. I'm not putting up with it.Funding Target: $216The funding target is just enough to cover the cost of 12 t-shirts, the printing and shipping, and the fees charged by Kickstarter and the credit card processor. The cost of printing increases with the number of colors needed for the art and this shirt uses two colors.Bottom line: For a $18 pledge, you get a t-shirt. Shipping is included as part of the pledge. I can include shipping because I am shipping using first class to only US based addresses, keeping costs predictable and affordable.I am making shirts that I plan on wearing. The message is important and so is comfort. Instead of flimsy, quickly worn-out “concert t-shirts” , I am using Hanes®  Beefy T-shirts. When you think about nice t-shirts, these are the shirts you have in mind, And the engineers at Hanes have been tidrelessly making them better than ever, offering greater durability and less shrinkage than you'll get with ordinary tees.    Ultra-soft premium cotton feels great against your skin. Non-chafe fabric taping reinforces neck and shoulders.Lay Flat collar keeps its shape wash after wash.Tag-free for itch-free comfort. Durable double stitching trims sleeves and bottom hem. Full cut provides roomier fit (preshrunk to stay true to size). Also available for kids. Length of Tall Beefy-T is 3 inches longer than average size and is available in LT (Large Tall) - 4XLT.100% cotton jersey, 6.1 oz.As soon as this project is 100% funded, I will add long sleeves and hoodies as new rewards.Trump is wrong so many ways, how could I make just one shirt? I couldn't! This shirt is only one from a series. One at a time and In turn, each shirt in the series will become the heart of another Kickstarter campaign.Below is the artwork for a some of the shirts I hope to create in the near future.   I would love to get any feedback, comments or suggestions concerning this project or other shirts in the series.“If I were to remain silent, I'd be guilty of complicity.” ― Albert EinsteinI don't need to protest all of the time. In fact, I had just had eight years of celebrating more than protesting. But in times like these, I have a duty to speak out. When I join others, we speak more loudly. So, personally, maybe the most important result of this project will be wearing this shirt. [missing]. If [missing] is important to you, I would be proud if you wore this shirt, too. And together we can protest, more loudly.“Patriotism means to stand by the country. It does not mean to stand by the president...” ― Theodore Roosevelt Life is filled with risk. Hard to deny when you consider that Trump is president.This Kickstarter project is less about funding the creative process and more like ordering a t-shirt.  I have minimized risk for the backer by completing most of the necessary tasks before seeking your support. Pressing ink onto the fabric is the final step needed to make this shirt real.Still, unlikely events occasionally happen. Our printer could suffer catastrophic equipment failure, Trump might punch in the launch codes. I do expect that this project will finish smoothly and quickly. I'm excited and looking forward to wearing this shirt.
DOCTOR WHO: THE MENACE OF FOONF|successful|“Doctor Who: The Menace of Foonf” is a Doctor Who fan film that we, John Gervais and Taro O’Halloran, are producing. This film is going to revolve around the Eleventh and Twelfth Doctors from the BBC series, Doctor Who. It will also be featuring all of the previous incarnations of the Doctor, from 1 to 10, including the War Doctor. We don't want to reveal too much of the plot at this time, but we have a fully fledged and full length episode conceptualized, and a script in the process. Many notable cosplayers from the Doctor Who costuming community will be featured in the story, including but not limited to, Thomas Dunn (@Doctorwhocollector) Phoebe Britnell (@Phoebeb96) and Léon McGann (@Doctor_Mcgann). This film will have visual effects done by A&V Artwork, otherwise known as Ben Walden. We need you to help fund this project for various different parts of production. We will be putting our own time and money into the film, and your donations will only be a boost to help make this the best we can possibly make it. Your donations will help fund costumes, props, sets, visual effects, and much more. As you can see, gifts you may receive for donating include personal letters and videos thanking you, access to behind the scenes content, concept art, Skype sessions with us where you can give your input and discuss aspects of the production with us, and even props and costume pieces! We sincerely want to make this film as excellent as we possibly can, and we hope we can please fans of Doctor Who with it. We hope you'll consider donating to this project, because it's going to be a whopper!Everyone working on this project has real-life commitments outside this project. Full-time jobs, house work, college, etcetera. Although we do not anticipate any of these things to delay us, unforeseen circumstances may arise. Regardless of the potential for delays, we will keep our donators updated and will stay on top of any issues.
Bird's Eye View 1892 Map of Atlanta - 1000 Piece Puzzle|successful|The Bird’s Eye View Map of Atlanta in 1892 is our first puzzle. We are excited to bring this beautiful historic image to life in a tabletop format. As we are located in Atlanta, this project is special to us, and we hope to you as well. The puzzle is comprised of 1,000 unique pieces and measures 20 x 28 inches when assembled.Puzzle prototype box design - subject to minor changes About the Map & Artist:  Augustus Koch was born in Germany in 1840. He moved to the US before the Civil War where he served in The Corps of Engineers. After the war, he traveled to cities around the country and illustrated Bird’s Eye View maps from hot air balloons. Augustus drew a series of perspective based maps from dozens of locations. In 1892, he tied off his hot air balloon near Grant Park and created this beautifully drawn map of Atlanta and the surrounding area complete with notable locations and street names.Residents and non-residents of Atlanta will enjoy comparing the late 19th century landscape to today. Whether you’re purchasing it as an activity to complete with your family, or as a gift for someone else, this gorgeous map lets you assemble the history of Atlanta, piece by piece.STRETCH GOAL:  If we can reach $4,000, we will be able to use a different printing technique to allow for a higher quality box. The puzzle itself will remain unchanged as that level of quality is already being done at the primary funding target. Should that new production process goal be reached, we will be able to redesign the box to a slightly different graphic layout. Bird's Eye View Map of Atlanta in 1892Help us make our own history as a new startup studio by purchasing this challenging puzzle.

Autopsy of a Dying Man|failed|Autopsy of a Dying Man is a series of five books that tells the story of my father contracting cancer and facing death. They provide a harrowing and amusing account of living, loving and facing death head-on. These books are inspirational for people with cancer and they are also a superb biographical account of a life worth living. Each chapter is full of  wonderful anecdotes about life, love and growing up as well as showing how you can enjoy life even though you might be facing death.Paddy, has written these volumes, starting with Autopsy of a Man at Work that tells the story of  him growing up in Apartheid South Africa without the benefits that many white people experience. Like most youngsters from Soweto, Paddy and his brothers were brought up by his mother as a single parent although, unlike his brothers, Paddy maintained a constant communication with his Dad. By the time Paddy was sixteen, he had to leave school carrying a minimal education and a rucksack full of determination. He could not afford to get a matric or a tertiary education but he was determined to get a job on a newspaper. He succeeded after much peristence by being employed as a photographer on The Daily Dispatch, working under the notorious Donald Woods. From there his tales expand as we follow his path into journalism and eventually to peer recognition for his writing.Autopsy of a Man in Love explains the migration from a simple, single bachelor boy into a family man. It outlines some of the difficulties of living with an alcoholic wife but it also provides an insight into how Kate (my younger sister) and I were brought up as independent, determined and free-thinking individuals. Autopsy of a Man with Cancer starts with Dad explaining how my mother, Jacquie, died of lung cancer in 2004. Mom died within a month of being diagnosed with the dreaded disease. From there my Dad goes on to recount how his diagnosis of Squamous Cell Carcinoma, changed his life, leaving him unable to talk after the his soft palate was removed. It tracks the real difficulities of dealing with this cancer and what the doctors who treated him did not tell him about the therapies, particularly regarding radiation therapy, a procedure he should have avoided at all costs. It tracks the cancer from the mouth to the lymph glands, and the block resection of his neck and shoulder. He faced serious side-effects from radiation after this resection and that convinced my Dad that radiation therapy should be used as a last resort for people with head and neck cancers. To add to his woes, he was diagnosed with Adeno Carcinoma of the colon forcing him to have part of his colon removed.Autopsy of a Man Alive tracks Paddy's determination to continue living a normal life (within the confines of his cancers), maintain his sense of humour and not fall into the void of depression most cancer sufferers feel. This volume, like the others, is full of amusing and depressing anecdotes about life and love while cancers continue to eat inside him.Dad goes on to tell how, in Autopsy of a Dying Man, he had to confront his death from either Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the jaw or from Adeno Carcinoma that was now in his liver. We are told, by doctors, that my dad wil die because one or other cancer will kill him. But Paddy is a determined man and in April 2016, seven years after his initial diagnosis in 2009 he has just survived a 14-hour operation to replace his bottom jaw using his fibula and taking muscle from his left leg and from the right side of his chest to replace tissues in his jaw and right shoulder.Please support us by keeping Dad alive for long enough to finish his books because, after seven years his funds have just about run out and he needs to raise cash to print his books for retailers and to make digital E-books in different formats that are compatible with Amazon, Apple's iBooks and in PDF format as well. He has almost finished the final volume and, with your help, will complete it by the end of this year or early in the New Year. Then the task of printing and publishing the books begins and that is why I need to raise money now to help Dad. This is a work in progress that is very near completion. The risks and challenges of Autopsy of a Dying Man rely on collecting enough money to keep Paddy alive and pay for his medical treatments and bills until the fifth volume is complete. The other four have been written and finalised.  Paddy has undertaken that, in return for an investment of either £25 or £50 the following rewards will apply: Each person making a pledge of £25 will receive a complete digital set of E-books as a reward for the pledge as soon as all five volumes are complete. Paddy has also agreed that those pledging £50 or more will get a complete set of printed copies, as a boxed set and limited edition. Only 1,250 limited editions will be available. The biggest risk facing Autopsy of a Dying Man is that Paddy runs out of money, cannot afford his medical teatments and is unable to finish his five-volume work. He has completed four of the five volumes and is in the process of updating the fifth volume. Paddy needs to be able to pay the print costs, the digital pubishing costs, his living, medical and treatment costs as well.There are no outside parties that need to approve the rewards offered. Paddy has no external parties or other investors involved in Autopsy of a Dying Man.If Paddy should die unexpectedly, his contracted editor has sufficient information to complete Autopsy of a Dying Man and follow through on the pledges and undertakings that Paddy has given.If you want to know more about what Paddy has done over the years, Google him on Paddy Hartdegen. There you can see the many columns and books he has written and find out more about his achievments.
Art Lovers Place|failed|"This video was taken July 18, 2014. I purchased a long-time vacant, gutted out building missing half its roof the summer of 2014.

How I Got Beat-Up By The FBI When I Was Four Years Old|failed|Greetings:I'm almost finished with my book and just need a few hundred dollars to pay for last minute proof changes. The Book should be for sale on Amazon by December 15, 2014. It will sell for 7 dollars. The Kindle download will sell for about 2.35.I quote from the cover:No child should be asked to mix liquor drinks, but Dee Hill is an expert by the age of three.  His gregarious but moody father needs help entertaining his hard-drinking friends, so little Dee takes up the shot glass--and thus begins his wild ride called life.In his memoir Hill explores how his challenging childhood set him on a life path that would lead from one unusual experience after another.Even after he leaves the Boston area and all its eccentric characters from his own family to the friendly neighborhood mobsters, craziness follows him from across the United States to Europe to Japan. Hill experiences cold war intrigue, has bizarre celebrity encounters and makes a bundle in the stock market crash of 1987.Delivered with a comic's instinct for deadpanning, his stories, whether hilarious or frightening, entertain with extraordinary honesty and wit.Anyway that's what the Madmen at Amazon say about the book.The only risk is that the book might come out a week later than I thought.No other problems are foreseen.
Pony Death Ride is making an album!|successful|"Who the hell is Pony Death Ride?   We get that alot. If we're asking for your help, we should probably get to know each other a little. We are Pony Death Ride, a comedy-punk rock-cabaret duo from San Diego, CA. We met while playing in other bands, then went nuts and got married. We play shows at burlesque events, caberet shows, and your typical rock n roll joint. Comedy shows too! Here we are in 2011 in Oakland:Hubba Hubba Review Oakland 2011We set out earlier this year to record our debut CD, ""Kung Fu and Circus"", then a crazy thing happened:We ran out of money. Crap!    So to finish our project, we thought we would enlist you, music lover. The good thing is, everyone who helps fund the project gets a copy of our CD, and if you look at the rewards section, things just get nuts after that. Imagine holding a copy of our CD and telling your friends, ""this project wouldn't of happened without my support."" Then you can kind of turn your head up in that real cocky sort of way, ya know. Also, for every nice thing you do, the universe allows you to do two bad things as compensation! (universal good to bad ratio not always acurate).Slow down, folks, we hear you say. ""Why help  these guys?"" ""Why not Jerry's kids?"" First of all, who knows where that money even goes. That Jerry Lewis has a sneaky look about him that makes me  uneasy. Funds for our project, on the other hand, go directly to the project. Here's a breakdown:Finishing up recording and CD mastering:   $500CD artwork and layout : $200CD duplication: $300So you see, every penny is accounted for! Also, if the goal is not met, we do not get funded a dime and all pledges are returned. Without you, our projected could not be funded, so we would turn to a life of crime.

Love Animals - Debut EP Project|failed|This project is quite simply an effort to aid in the production of our debut release. Our plans are to record to several track with our good friend Travis Kammeyer at Fahrenheit Studios followed by mixing and mastering at a location to be determined. Once completed, the CD will be released in full color digipaks. We're extremely excited to get this recording underway, but unfortunately with quality comes a high cost. That's where backers like you come in! Every person who pledges is making an investment in our music and taking a piece of this project for themselves. We thank you all for even considering to make a pledge and can't wait to get this thing off the ground!With any recording, there is always a risk of release date being pushed back due to certain factors. We plan to tackle this project full force, in a timely manner, and with quality results.

Bridge of Sighs Short Film -- Part 2|successful|Help us Make a Film!  Our goal is to produce this poignant, soul-stirring film using the DIY (Do-It-Yourself) mode of fundraising that’s becoming the norm for artists around the world.We believe you, the audience, might not ever be allowed to enjoy this powerful story the way it was originally conceived. Now you can…Pledge NOW!Title: “Bridge of Sighs” is the feeling of crossing from one place to another in a manner that effects profound change.Story: When a juvenile inmate is faced with potential transfer to an adult prison for his double-murder conviction he must convince a parole board that he’s worthy of a second chance instead of potential life in prison.The story Matthew Briley tells about a lynching and the subsequent deaths of two white men is one of anger, hate, defiance, and true moral conviction in the face of madness.His story is one of redemption and hope, told by a young teenage kid who asks the existential question, “Does no good deed go unpunished?”Matthew Briley in handcuffs...Characters:MATTHEW BRILEY: Caught in the sick, pathetic web of his father’s hateful, angry, and violent behavior, Matthew must act on a moral lesson his father could never teach him – he who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it. He who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it.PETE BRILEY: An angry, hateful, racist man. He’s the worst of what it means to be a father, and his physical abuse of Matthew leads to the climactic ending, where the father learns a lesson from his son.JOE GREGORY: Nearest to evil incarnate as one might imagine, his world is one of hatred, jealousy, and violent intimidation. He leads the lynch mob in their hate-filled mission to hang Clifford Etienne.CLIFFORD ETIENNE: A black man in rural late-50s Louisiana who may or may not have slept with a white woman. Of importance are his claims of innocence that go unheard and his son, Bingo, who’s best friends with Matthew.Setting: Begins with 1962 parole-board hearing, in a country on the verge of the civil rights era, with a flashback to 1959, in a rural country field, under a canopy of oak trees, where this angry lynch mob wants to hang Clifford Etienne.Themes: Spirit of the law versus the letter of the law, where an adolescent has killed two men, but their innocence is questionable.The dilemma of what someone should do when faced with bearing witness to evil, and whether violence should be answered and overcome with violence.Issues: The recent Supreme Court ruling that some 2,000 juvenile offenders serving life sentences without parole should have hope of eventual release.The court ruled that laws requiring youths convicted of murder to be sentenced to die in prison violate the Eighth Amendment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment.Racism in the old south and racism in the new south – how far have we come since these times of peril and fear? How does lynching fit into the great American mythology?Importance: We’re living in an epoch of massive flux, where there’s a tremendous amount of angst, hatred, bigotry, intolerance, and violence as a part of our daily existence.If we can face the truth of our past, we can imagine a future of change.Production: Where is all this money going? Even though most cast and crew are volunteering their time and energy for free, we still have to pay for things like:•	Insurance – yea, we might break something•	Equipment – camera, lenses, lights, grip truck, etc.•	Locations -- rural Louisiana is tough to scout•	Production Design – we’re gonna make it look real•	Props – lotsa fire and some guns•	Vehicles – especially 50s and 60s cars/trucks•	Costumes – again, 50s and 60s wardrobe•	Makeup – actors need this for bruising, blood, etc.•	Transportation – gettin’ to and from back-country Louisiana•	Food – most everyone's working for free, but they have to eat•	Post-Production and Sound – we’re professionals with big-boy toys•	Music Licensing and Composition – for song at the end, when titles roll•	Etc. – snake anti-venom, mud boots, coffee, lotsa coffeeAbout Kickstarter: Kickstarter projects work on an all-or-nothing basis: if we fail to meet our funding goal by the end of our 40-day deadline, we receive nothing.Your pledged funds won't be charged from your account until 8/29, and only if we reach our funding goal. So pledge now and pay later! Please.If we fail to reach our $1,400 goal by the deadline, all pledges will be cancelled, and no funds will be charged to your account.Sadly, this might mean the lost opportunity to make a terrific little film, not to mention that you won’t get the great rewards being offered.Don’t you want to get involved? Be a part of this awesome project!Southern Louisiana weather in November... otherwise, we are good to go!
Legendary Steamboat Springs Band records an album-- after 30 years!|failed|"In the 1970's in Myrtle Beach, there was no bigger or more loved band than The Steamboat Springs Band. They played with everyone, they had a huge following... but it was a lot harder to get your sound out and get signed in 1978 than it is now. And after years of living in this giant dilapidated old house together, they split up.This year, the band's best friend/manager “Giant Jeff” unexpectedly passed away during a routine surgery at the age of 55, leaving a practically orphaned 13 year old son. Jeff is literally a giant on the Grand Strand, where southern rock was born. He owned a record store & was instrumental in spreading music to everyone. He founded the SouthXSoutheast Music Festival. Everyone loved him.The band & the community of Myrtle Beach organized a reunion/tribute concert in support of Jeff’s festival and to start a college fund for his son, Hunter.The reunion was AMAZING. Hundreds and hundreds of people came and everyone agreed at the end of the week, that no one wanted it to end. A piece of magic was recaptured and the band vowed to get back together in the best way they could, starting (but hopefully not ending) with recording a real album of their original tunes to be recorded in Atlanta in August .Anything to keep the magic going.So I'm doing this for my dad, who has supported literally every dream I've ever had. Getting to see him reunited with his dream (and clearly a band that meant so much to so so many people) was one of the best things I've experienced to date.Their Bluegrass meets Southern Rock, Allman Brothers meets Bill Monroe sound resonates with their tried and true fans, and now with a new generation.Everyone loves a comeback story.‎""The fame that has escaped you doesn't matter/because you'll ride next year the way you rode before."" -- Dave Zauner"

Maree v. State: Not Just A Documentary|successful|"“Sydney Maree is one ofthe world’s fastest runners. There’s no argument about that. The controversy isover whether he is the hero, or the villain, or the victim, of a tale thatmight have been written by Horatio Alger and Franz Kafka.” - BobLipsyte, CBSMaree v. State explores the life of my father, Sydney Maree, whose career serves as a metaphor for the evolution of the South African state, from Apartheid to modern democracy. This feature-length documentary traces the parallels between Maree’s personal story and the historical, political andcultural contexts within which his life can be understood. Of particularinterest are the ways in which his experiences can reveal inconvenientnational truths, which have been covered up or subsumed in official histories and collective memory. Website: www.mareevstate.com Who is Sydney Maree? (Background)Born on September 9,1956 in Cullinan, South Africa, Sydney Maree was raised by his aunts, unclesand grandparents. Political forces kept him away from his parents. The SouthAfrican government imprisoned his father on Robben Island for his resistancework with the ANC and Pan African Congress, while his mother worked as a housemaid, raising other families’ children in whites-only Pretoria.As part of the apartheidgovernment policy to remove ‘black spots’ of settlement from desirable land,Maree’s family was forcibly removed to Hammanskrall in the early 1960s. After afew years there, he grew up in Atteridgeville, a black township outside ofPretoria. Maree remembers the traumatic experience of being forced off the landhis family had legally owned for generations before the government sold it to Afrikaans farmers.Growing up, Mareedemonstrated a talent for running. While still a schoolboy in 1976, less thansix months after the Soweto Riots, he gained national and internationalattention by running his first sub-four minute mile. With a time of 3:57.9,Maree’s performance was the second fastest high school mile ever recorded and the first and only sub four-minute mile run by a South African schoolboy,propelling him into the international track and field spotlight. He was named South Africa’s “Black Sportsman of the Year” andwon a sponsored trip to the United States.Under the instruction oflegendary track and field coach Jumbo Elliot at Villanova University, Mareeworked to become a World Record-holder in the 1500-meters, a U.S. citizen, anda two-time Olympian for the United States. But Maree reached prominence at atime when international sport bodies began boycotting South Africa in reactionto the legalized racism practiced under Apartheid. Maree experienced theboycotts firsthand; he was barred from competing internationally for four ofhis most prime competitive years.""In South Africa, I was punished for being black,’he said. ‘In the United States, I was punished for being South African. Itbuilt me and it broke me. But it built me more than it broke me.”    Despitethese hurdles, Maree received American citizenship in 1984 and went on tobecome a two-time Olympian for the U.S. (1984 and 1988). Maree’s victory in the inaugural 5th Avenue Mile in New York (1981), where he missed breaking Sebastian Coe's world mile track record by five hundredths of a second, placed him firmly on the international athletics map and remains unsurpassed. He would go onto hold four U.S.records in the 1500m, 2,000m, 3,000m and 5,000m races, making him one of thetop 5 U.S. athletes of all time. Maree retired in 1991 and returned to South Africa in 1995 to participate in the country’s democratic transition.In 2004 Sydney Maree, was inducted into the South African National Hall of Fame and awarded South Africa’s highest civil honor for “excellent achievement in the field of athletics and contribution to non-racial sport.” His life, President Thabo Mbeki said, was “inextricably linked with the struggle against oppression and racism in South Africa.” That same year, as one of the countries leading Economists, Maree was appointed CEO of the National Empowerment Fund (NEF): a state-owned enterprise within South Africa’s Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), established to facilitate black economic equality and transformation in the country.The TrialShortly thereafter, Maree was charged with fraud in connection to a no-bid contract with Deutsche Bank Securities. But the close relationship between then Minister of Trade and Industry (Alec Erwin, Maree’s boss) and the head of Deutsche Bank South Africa (Martin Kingston) was cited as the primary motive for the deal, leaving many to wonder if Maree was simply a scapegoat. Around the same time, evidence damaging to the Mbeki Administration (including several of Maree's superiors) began to surface with regard to South Africa’s $4.8 billion Arms Deal.In 2008, after several delays and judicial irregularities (including “missing” evidence), Maree was convicted of Fraud and sentenced to 10 years in prison. He began serving his sentence earlier this year after being denied the right to Appeal. Many questions remain, the answers to which are increasingly important as investigations into the Arms Deal reopen in South Africa and parallel investigations begin in the United Kingdom and Germany.Why Should You Support this Project?As AlecRussell writes, “South Africa’s negotiated transition from white rule todemocracy was one of the wonders of the late twentieth century. But it was onlythe first chapter of the postliberation narrative.” Maree v. State is not just a film; its a campaign for South Africa's ""Second Chapter"" -- the realization of the ideals of the liberation struggle: economic equality, democracy, and good governance. Funds raised inthis campaign will go towards upfront production costs, including: crew traveland expenses, cameras and equipment, and third-party licensing fees. Any additional funds raised will be dedicated to the social action campaign.Thisproject means everything to me and I am fully invested in seeing it through. By investing in this project you are investing in me. Anythingyou can pledge to help me share this story is deeply appreciated.

My large fund raising amount is to pay for a thirty day trip to Coco Beach FL This includes. lodging & Shelter ($3,000) - food ($2,250) -supplies ($1,500) - Vehicle expenses ($1,000) - equipment such as cameras and Camera related supplies and equipment, props, on location expenses ($2,000) - Instructors and rentals for four people, for a week ($2,000) – the rest is to pay for rewards, kick starter fee, and a rainy day fund to pay for unseen expenses along the way. I cant promise a high quality music video, I am differently amateur. But I well do my best to provide you with a few laughs and images that will leave you wanting more, leave you wishing you had done this yourselves.Fulfillments of the project may take a little time, and request at least 90 days to wrap up post production before shipping rewards. Risks and challengesThe obvious risks and challenges are going to be injuries, exposure to the elements, fatigue, failure or loss of equipment and weather. This is one reason for the rainy day fund. It’s not just for when it’s raining.

Following Racine: The East Africa Safari Rally|successful|Hello, I’m Helen, and I’m a little camera-shy, so I’ll start with the nuts & bolts of my project in text.This project of mine began as a simple character sketch. Agitated by a muse, I sat down one day and started writing. The character did not so much introduce herself as lay it down quick that her name is Racine. I kept writing and soon other characters showed up, Jagroop for one. He walked into a Greek restaurant in Manhattan where Racine was sitting alone at the bar having a drink. Racine had never met a Sikh before and neither had I. Nor had she ever met a rally racer before, neither had I. A few pages on as the personalities stretched their legs, so to speak, and additional characters appeared I accepted that I was in deeper with this writing than I anticipated. I saw that a novel was underway and that I was not the driver but rather something like a navigator. My potent crew of leading characters is heading to Africa, a place they know far better than I, and so my choices are stark: stay behind and lose out on the action – or pack my bags and go along too.

Sky Lounge: A Visual EP|failed|"Sky Lounge will be an exciting addition to my existing work and similar to ""Boarding Pass"" provide continued narration on my global travel experience (10 countries and counting).  I have been able to fund my projects up to this point independently, but now my work is calling for a push into something larger and more coordinated. Sky Lounge was a seed that quickly grew in conjunction with my LP ""Boarding Pass"". Funding for this Visual EP will go towards equipment fees and pre/post-production expenses.As similar to all independent musicians, I consider my music as an expression of my views and experiences. ""My art is my music and my music is my expression"". Risks: - Much of the pre-production and filming will be done by a small group of producers who will volunteer their time. Should scheduling conflicts arise, I am certain they will be addressed with the necessary attention. - There are minimal risks associated with delivering the funding rewards, suppliers of promo (swag) materials are consistent and dependable. Challenges: As with all creative projects, community reception may not be as positive as desired. In an effort to portray a consistent persona, several links featuring past performances and tracks have been added for public review."

I promise that you will see immediate improvement after your first application and you will never want to be without Acne Dust ™ after you see the results from continued use.Cheers to great skin! ♥natural acne and oily skin care Since I began marketing this product over a year ago on ETSY, I have received tons of emails and order requests from around the world.The most expensive part of this project is purchasing the necessary packaging and labeling (and whatever else is required in certain countries) to make this available to everyone at a very affordable price and FREE for those who simply cannot afford and have to struggle with acne and breakouts everyday.Since starting my business and developing this product, I have given away tons of this powder (which is what I set out to do in the beginning) because I want ALL people to experience the benefits!  Some people simply cannot afford an extra $14.95 a month to keep their skin clear and looking healthy.Those who cannot afford- as well as those who spend countless hours in dermatology offices and TONS of money on high dollar skin care products, corporate pharmaceutical companies, topicals and hormones to manage their skin conditions.  It really isn't the product itself that is overly expensive to make.  It's the required packaging, labeling, shrink-wrapping, and shipping that tends to break the bank--not to mention the marketing (for which I do most of own social media, SEO and growth hacking) --but one still has to pay for certain social media applications in to compete with other financially viable companies that are still pushing chemicals and toxins in makeup and skincare.There are no chemicals, preservatives or parabens in this formula, which consists of only 6 organic ingredients. No side effects or allergic reactions have ever been reported. The minute you powder your face, your skin feels better instantly.I have no doubt that we can and will continue to offer our Outreach Program for AcneDust™ to those around the world who need it but cannot afford it.  It's easy to use. Clearer Complexions. Happier People. A better life!No one wants to face the world with breakouts and pimples- so I'm asking you to help me to help them. Maybe we could end some of the tween and teen bullying that goes on in our country and save some lives.Just last week in Georgia alone, a 12 year old girl committed suicide after being constantly bullied at school because of her complexion.Help me stop some of this madness.  Teens and tweens are not emotionally mature enough to handle all the meanness no matter how much we tell them we love them just the way they are.Love and Light and Thanks!  Please help me to pay it forward ♥
The Legendary Cobo|failed|"OUR SINCERE THANKS!Jake and I have been humbled by the amount of encouragement and kind words that we have received during the course of our funding campaign. We truly are thankful for all the great people who shared our dream of making this movie a reality.Unfortunately, time has run out and we have not reached our goal.I can't even guess why it failed but we will continue to move forward with the project as our personal finances allow.Our goal was to finish the movie in time to make the 2013 festival entry deadlines this fall but now it will be at least until the 2014 festival season before we will have anything ready.At this point we will have to abandon our plans to include all the incredible historic film footage.The cost of the restoration and digital transfers is simply beyond our personal financial resources.We made some great new friends, learned a lot and had many wonderful moments during our promotion.I can't say THANK YOU loud enough to everyone who helped and pledged support!THANK YOU, DETROIT!!THANK YOU, to the WORLD!!Sincerely, Doug and Jake.UPDATE: NEW REWARD!We've just been given a very generous gift for a $500 level reward.A dinner with award winning music journalist and author Gary Graff.You'll be one on one with one of greatest insiders of rock and roll!Have you always wanted know something about your favorite rock star?Well Gary is the man to ask.He will also throw in a personally signed copy of one of his books from his ""Music Hound"" series or ""The Ties That Bind: Bruce Springsteen A to E to Z"", the definitive study of The Boss.Restaurant choice will be in the Metro Detroit area  and at Gary's discretion.Only 2 available so act fast!The MovieDuring the half-century Cobo Arena had been standing, it grew to legendary status and cemented a worldwide love and respect for this unique venue.View the full length trailer.Why are we doing this?We love Cobo. That's why we started this film.What surprised us was the love that the rock stars and celebrities have for Cobo. Their willingness to be interviewed and excitement while telling personal tales about Cobo exceeded all our expectations.When the celebrities began to thank us for making this film, we knew our passion was well placed.The StoryWhen Cobo Arena opened in 1960, its state-of-the-art acoustic design provided a unique performance theatre at a time when public address systems were still in their infancy. In that first decade Cobo played host to many diverse and historic events such as the first NCAA Indoor Track and Field Championships and Dr. Martin Luther King’s “I Have A Dream” speech (months before the Washington version) at the Great March on Detroit while becoming the most widely loved performance venue in the world.In the decades to come Cobo Arena would be the mecca of professional wrestling with “Big Time Wrestling” featuring the legendary Sheik and Bobo Brazil, as it also became the home of the live music record. Some of the greatest live albums of all time were recorded here by artists including The Doors, Yes, KISS, Bob Seger, Kid Rock, Journey, Hank Williams Jr. making Cobo a benchmark for success. Cobo Arena would play a role in many other important events in history, such as breaking the political barrier with China in 1972, through what is popularly known as “Ping Pong Diplomacy"". Cobo would also be the site of some very infamous moments...About The RewardsYes, we have 2 pair of original Cobo seats. These would be a killer addition to any memorabilia collection. You can smell the 70's on these things! We really, REALLY hate to give these up but we need every little bit to help us complete the movie.Our interview stools that had a bunch of rock star butts on them. Who sat on which one? We have no idea but they do appear in the movie.The Cobo campaign buttons. These are replicas of the buttons from Mayor Albert Cobo's 1956 gubernatorial bid.They're about 2 1/2 inches across and look just like this digital rendering.The Cobo House Party.Whenever we have gotten together with friends and fellow film makers, the conversation inevitably turns to the celebrity interviews that we did for this movie.The question is usually something like, ""How the hell did you pull that off?""After telling the entire crazy story the overwhelming response was that these stories would make a great movie in and of themselves!So after some encouragement we decided to put together a TED Talks type of presentation that takes the audience on our journey through the making of this movie.It's told by Jake and I firsthand and accompanied by behind the scenes photos and video clips as we speak.Like everything we do it will be a polished and professional production.So here's how this reward works:For the $500 donation we will travel up to 100 miles from metro Detroit to your house, bringing a compact setup with a small sound system and a nice flat panel display.Jake and I will host a 40 minute-ish presentation and then take questions and hang out for awhile to talk to anyone and everyone.A few FAQs about this reward:Q. How many people can I invite?A. How many can you fit in your living room? Seriously though, we would like to keep this personal. In other words, renting out a local clubhouse or bar and charging admission is not what we want. We think around 20 people or so would be the ideal maximum.Q. My school/organization would like to host a large event with your presentation. Can we work that out?A. Of course! We do have plans to speak at larger events. If you'd like to schedule a large event, contact us and we will work out the details/additional costs,etc.Q. I live in Australia. Will you still come to my house?A. YES! But... you will have to include travel and accommodation costs.For any parties outside of our 100 mile zone we will have to work with you on any additional costs to get us there and if we need a hotel room, etc.We're not trying to make more money off of you, just offset our cost to get there.Q. Can you do one next week?A. We can't even think about scheduling one until the movie is done. Our time frame for beginning these presentations starts in January 2013.They will generally have to be on a weekend and we plan to do between 4 and 6 a month on a first come first served basis.Q. Nobody is going to pay for this! We don't care about your stories.A. If we don't sell any, we're cool with that. It's a long shot to sell this sort of thing but we have been encouraged to include it. So move along...How we will use the moneyThe amount of 16mm newsreel footage on Cobo is staggering. Just trying to decide which reels will get preservation is going to be tough. I wish we could pay to have all of it done but that would be way beyond this moderate budget.Once funding is complete we can begin the process of preservation and digital transfer of the historic film.This film is a key element we need to complete our Cobo story and will help us to give proper context to all the events we will cover.Bono film labs in College Park Maryland is our choice of transfer house for a variety of reasons. One of which is they are National Archives accredited, meaning they do the job right and don't cut corners.  At this point before adding any more footage we may find, our restoration and transfer cost is projected to be about $18,000.One of our first priorities upon successful funding will be to hire a tax accountant. Yes, Amazon Payments reports all the money from Kickstarter to the IRS.We all know that tax law is like a minefield and navigating that convoluted map is beyond our capability. It goes without saying that we will need to make sure all of the I's are dotted and T's are crossed with our LLC and that our tax obligations are properly addressed.Oh yeah, Amazon and Kickstarter also each take 5% of our successful funding too.Right now I'm looking at a box of more than 120, 60 minute HDV tapes of all of the footage we shot during the interview phase of production. I only have about half of it captured at ProRes 422 into my computer because I've run out of hard drive space! 12 terabytes running at near capacity. Of course not every single minute of footage will be used but until a rough cut is complete, all of the footage has to loaded. When the 16mm transfers come, they will also have to be brought into the system.The plan is to acquire a series of RAID arrays to backup and archive all of the tapes and make them available to my editing system. A 12 terabyte enterprise spec hardware RAID with 7200 rpm drives runs just under $3000.  I will probably need two. My current editing system is a bit outdated. A 2008 Mac Pro running Final Cut Pro 7. It will get the job done but like all computers it has it's moments of being a pain in the ass.We will also expand our staff to include: A graphic designer who will handle the DVD and BLU-RAY covers, theatrical poster design and whatever else I can throw at them like, updating our logo. A website designer who will give it the professional touch and wow factor that it needs. A post production audio guru to handle all the tweaking and help to build a killer music score.An assistant editor to log the hours of tape and also to handle the motion graphics for the movie titles and credits.And of course a great Publicist to get the movie out there!It's a lot of work to get done and we plan to hire people who are good at what they do and we will have to pay them a fair price for their work.Then of course there are the actual DVDs and Blu-Rays of the movie that will have to be produced along with a few promotional items like posters for the festivals and lobby cards.I think I've covered the majority of our expenses but I'm sure there will be even more that crop up as we move along.Cobo Hall, Cobo Arena. What's the difference?Throughout the years Cobo has been known by many names. Officially, it is the Cobo conference and event center. There are two parts to the center and both names are often used to describe what we know as the concert venue.Cobo Hall is the large floor area used for the annual Auto Show and is designed as an exhibition space with the ability to subdivide into smaller areas. It sits north and west of the attached Arena.Cobo Arena was the 11,500 seat auditorium originally designed as a multi purpose public speaking venue. It's design was unique, more like a large theatre than what we know today as an arena. With its horseshoe interior shape, an acoustic ""waterfall"" back wall and finished walls and ceiling it gave attendees an unprecedented sound and visual experience. Designed during an era of primitive sound systems, it allowed everyone a good seat and the ability to hear everything. The entire facility became known as Cobo Hall and for the most part the monicker stuck. The Final ProductSo when the movie is done, when will you get to see it?That depends on where you'd like to see it.Our first screenings will be at film festivals throughout the USA.We haven't yet decided which festivals it will be submitted to or which one will host the world premiere but most festivals take place from early spring to early summer.We will provide regular updates as our festival strategy evolves and the scheduled screenings will be listed with plenty of lead time for you to make plans to attend.I wish we could offer a festival screening as part of our rewards but there is no way I could reserve tickets to a festival that we haven't even submitted to yet!Next will be our local Detroit premiere.It will take place immediately after our festival run is complete, around mid summer 2013, and will be hosted at one of the many great indie theatre's located in around the city.Finally, after all the theatre screenings are complete the BLU-RAYs, DVDs, and Digital Downloads will be delivered mid to late summer 2013.So there are your three options to see our final product.We hope you choose ALL THREE!So THANK YOU for supporting our project and please spread the word and send the link to your friends!Rock on!Doug and Jake."
Philip & Brittany Burton - NEW ALBUM - Nothing to Fear|successful|We are trying to raise $1000 to help turn these original worship songs into an amazing live recording in hopes of taking people deeper into the presence of God. In order to do this, we have a lot to coordinate and this money is just one aspect of it.Over the years, we have collected recording equipment which will help us track everything the night of--including the audience. After the live recording event is where the money you help us raise will come in. In order to take the recorded tracks and make them CD quality, we need to spend a significant amount of time in an actual recording studio making everything sound amazing. And that, of course, is not cheap. Thankfully, we have friends who can offer us a deal on studio time to make it more affordable. Once that is done, the project must also be mastered, which is another expense. Finally, money raised for this project will go towards distributing the music. This includes making physical copies and putting it in digital music stores (such as iTunes) worldwide. As you can see, there is a lot of money needed to make this recording all that it can be. We have estimated that $1000 would give us the funds to do all of this effectively. Of course, the more money we raise, the better the recording will sound!We hope that you see value in our project and want to partner with us to make it possible. Most importantly, we appreciate your prayers as we pursue all that God has called us to do!One of the biggest challenges to using the money raised effectively is managing our recording studio time. It is really easy to go overboard and spend way too many hours in the studio racking up a huge bill or even having to stop in the studio and ending up with a half completed album. In order to avoid this, we will be combing over the tracks after the live recording and making detailed lists of what needs to be fixed and adjusted so that we can make the most of our studio time. One of the other risks with attempting this project is quality. Getting a live recording to sound good in it's final form is very tough. To help us with that we are teaming up with a few people that have experience in this area to help us produce the album.
Mason-ry Silicone Koozie|successful|What Is The Mason-ry Koozie?The Mason-ry koozie is the first Silicone koozie designed from the ground up to perfectly fit a wide mouth pint jar. Whether it is drinking your morning coffee, your afternoon beer, or your evening cocktail, our koozies provide the best way to insulate your hot or cold beverage. At Mason-ry we were fed up with disposable coffee cups and oil and animal skin based koozies. So, we did something about it and created the koozie we wish we had.Where We Are TodayWe have spent the past six months designing, refining and prototyping the Mason-ry koozie. We now have the final design, a prototype that we are in love with and a manufacturer who is ready to start a production run. We are looking to Kickstarter to help us bring the first premium Silicone mason jar koozie to you!i. ConceptionAfter coming home from the 2013 Eugene Startup Weekend, Eric was motivated to move forward on his idea for a custom fit koozie for a mason jar. The goal was to create a koozie that looked great, felt great, and above all, promoted the use of safe and eco-friendly glass mason jars. Moreover, he aimed to appeal to not just the yarn, or leather koozie crowd, but everyone.ii. PrototypingWith that in mind, the goal was not just to create a great koozie, but the PERFECT koozie. Eric worked with local product designer, Alex Caves to invent the ideal koozie. From the start, we identified our unique lip that sits over the lip of the mason jar just below the threads as the key to the perfect koozie:Then we used 3D modeling to create a digital model of the koozie:Next we used scale photographs to determine the profile of a mason jar to the nearest 1/100 of an inch. Then we used 3D printing to make sure the final version would feel great in the hand:iii. The ResultOur manufacturing partner produced samples in 3 colors for us. They look and feel perfect. We can drink hot coffee or cold beer out of our mason jars and then toss them in the dishwasher. It is a dream come true to see our vision in real life:iv. Material Choice - Why Silicone?Simply put, Silicone is the only premium material for an eco-conscious koozie. No animal hides or petroleum products here. Just plentiful and easily sourced elements. Silicone can withstand temperatures from below-zero to over 400ºF, is non-toxic and contains no BPA. It can be microwaved. It can be dishwashed. It can be dropped. It can be baked in the oven. It can be thrown off a tall building or from a moving car (although you may have to replace the mason jar inside). Part of being eco-friendly is reducing the need for replacement, and by using Silicone, we ensure that our koozie will last a lifetime (well maybe not that long, but yes, a really long time).And Now For Where You Come InWe are looking for $7,500 to help us bring the Mason-ry koozie from prototype to product. In return for your support, you will receive a first run premium Mason-ry Silicone koozie and a custom Mason-ry logo temporary tattoo from the awesome folks at Tattly.com. We really appreciate your help and look forward to revolutionizing the mason jar koozie.UPDATE: We are thrilled that we met our stretch goal of $10k and can offer the option of a smooth sided koozie. This design will feature a smaller logo on the bottom (shipping will be a month longer for this design because we need to create a new mold). Additionally, we have partnered with EcoJarz to bring you an awesome lid. The lid shown below can be yours by adding $6 to any pledge level. Note- at the end of our funding period, we will collect all color/lid requests via a survey.The smooth sided koozie is now an option as well!Koozie + Lid UPDATE:  If we reach our stretch goal of $13k we will bring you an additional color option. Vote for your dream koozie color HEREBest,Eric and NicoleAt Mason-ry we know that it takes the right team to launch a product. We worked hard to set up everything from manufactures, to packaging partners (http://www.exceedpdx.com/ who do great things, check 'em out), to fulfillment (Fulfillment by Amazon) to make sure we can deliver without a hitch. However, we have enough real world experience to know that problems may arise. This is why we have assembled a high quality team of advisers to help Mason-ry at every step of the way. Manufacturing:The prototyping phase is complete and we know we have the ideal koozie. In order to make sure that production goes off without a hitch, we have partnered with a manufacturer who makes hundreds of Silicone parts and comes highly recommended. We already have samples and can see that they do great work. Additionally, we can count on Mike Hurrowitz, a skilled engineer from Boulder, Colorado to step in and help us should any issues arise during manufacturing. He has worked with 7 different startups as a founder or early employee. In doing so, he sent out over 100 unique parts for manufacture. With him as an adviser, we can fix any problems that crop up.FulfillmentWe also have Karen Bonner as an adviser. She is a founder of Red Duck Foods who launched a kickstarter (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1309695875/red-duck-ketchup)  which was successful funded on May 31, 2013. She successfully shipped ketchup to 599 backers. Compared to shipping glass jars of ketchup, shipping Silicone koozies is nothing!We have the gears and know how in place. The only missing part is your support!
Shirts for the East Idaho Aquarium|failed|"The StoryThe East Idaho Aquarium is a non-profit organization. We are currently working on acquiring our tax exempt status from the IRS. Once we get our tax exemptstatus, will go all out trying to find grants in order to bring this aquarium to Eastern Idaho. Many people have called us asking if this project is forreal, if this is something that is actually going to happen. They wanted to makesure we are not a bunch of teenagers just making a joke and gettingpeoples hopes up. Well the East Idaho Aquarium is a real thing and it isactually going to happen. Arron Faires, the president of the aquarium, has beeneagerly working on this project since February 2013. His desire to operate apublic aquarium dates all the way back to his early years in high school. About the PresidentAs I was growing up, my family had fish. It was something I would help my mom with when I was little. I was too young to remember, but she told me I used to love watching our Angelfish. My first memory of my family having fish was our community fish tank.My familywent to the store and bought a bunch of fish for our little ten gallon tank. My three brothers and I each got to pick a different kind of fish to add to the tank. I remember picking the Neon Tetras. However, they did not live very long because we made a few mistakes. Our next twofish to go into the tank were a Betta and a Goldfish. When the Betta died, we gavethe Goldfish away and bought Guppies. The Guppies were very fun to watch and werealways having babies. This is the tank I remember helping my mom clean from time totime. I did not get seriously into fish though until much later. When I was a Junior in High School I earned my Eagle Scout, and as a reward my parents bought me a 29 gallonfish tank. A couple of years before I was given the 29 gallon tank, I had really wanted some Oscars. When I was told how large Oscars grew to be, I was not able to getthem. So once I got that bigger tank, I went and picked out two Oscars for my tank. Igot a Red Oscar and a Tiger Oscar, which were my pride and joy at the time. Whenmy friends would come over we would feed them Goldfish; we thought they were socool. OscarsMy grandma later gave me a fish book and on the cover of the book was a beautiful Turquoise Discus. I really wanted to get one, but after a little bit ofresearch I realized they were very hard to take care of. It then became my goal toone day own a Discus. I wanted to be good enough at fish keeping to beable to care for the ""king of fish"" in the freshwater fish world. I would goto the library and check out fish books. I soon fell in love with planted tanks. Thethings people could do with live plants in an aquarium was amazing. I set it asone of my goals to have a beautiful planted tank. I tried for years to growlive plants with no real success. First Planted TankPeople would always tell me how cool the Denver aquarium was. They told me it was like a zoo, but all it had was fish. My dream job then became to own a public aquarium, but I dismissed it as just adream. I figured you needed lots of money to open something like that. Iknew I wanted to do something with fish though; I wanted to either study them, breed them, or sellthem.. After a few years I accumulated several tanks. At one time I had two 55 gallons, a 28 gallon bow front, a 29gallon, two 10 gallons, and a few bowls with various fish. I think everyoneshould own a least two big tanks; a tank with large fish and a communitytank. There is nothing like either. One of the tanks I have had through the yearsWhen I got married I thought my wife wasgoing to make me get rid of all my tanks. The opposite of what I thought actually occurred. She ended up liking fish too, just not as much as me. Although,not verymany people like fish as much as I do. One of the best things that happened tome was when I got hired at Petsmart. When I was first hired I thought forsure I would get to work in the fish department, but instead they made me a supplystocker. I long waited for the day when they would put me in the fish department. Itseemed like whenever an employee would quit from that part of the store, the position would be filled with someone who knew nothing about fish. It wasfunny because the new people would always ask me why I was not working with thefish, but I never could give them a good answer. Anytime a customer asked them aquestion they could not answer, they would come find me and ask me if Iknew the answer. I always did. During the time I was a stocker, there was anemployee who owned his own fish cleaning business. He recognized my passion forfish and hired me on to help him. During this time I learned how to grow liveplants. He taught me about certain types of water and water chemistry. Hehelped me start my path to reaching my goals of owning a Discus and having a beautifullyplanted tank. I now own Discus and have been told by many that I have beautifully plantedtanks. My discus and planted tank nowAfter a year of stocking, I finally got my chance to work in the fishdepartment. Customers always told me how it was a relief to have somebody thatactually knew what they were talking about. There were times that people wouldline up waiting to talk to me. Other associates would try to help those customers, but theywould decline the associates help and tell them they were waiting for me. When I wouldnot work,people would come into the store to see if I was there and upon finding outI was not they would turn around and leave. Not only did I help lots of people,but many people that would come in taught me new things.  I learned way more from other peoples experiences, than I did in all the years of reading and studying fish on my own. One of my best qualities is that I am never afraid to learn new things. I havenever been one to think that I know it all. The person that hired me to helphim clean tanks came to me one day and said we should open an aquarium. Hetold me how the Boise aquarium had been set up and how we could set one up too. I thought,""Awesome we can do this!"". More importantly, however; I can do this without needing millionsof dollars. We started a non-profit organization called the East Idaho Aquarium in Marchof 2013. I found out in August that he no longer wanted to be part of the East Idaho Aquarium. Afterhis quitting, I found a team to help me. Since getting my team together, more work was done for the Aquarium in one month than in the first five months with my original partner. Other than fish I like frisbee, soccer, football, basketball, and spending time with my wife and twolittle girls. LocationThe East Idaho Aquarium is hoping to secure the locationwhere the old Game World was. We like this location because of the heavy foottraffic that it receives. The location would allow for people to catch a movie,go to the aquarium, and eat lunch/dinner. If we do get this location then thecity of Ammon has told us they could waive our utility bill. Floor plans to theaquarium are being put together for this location. There is a high probabilitythis will be the location of the aquarium, but nothing is set in stone. Possible Floor PlanOur ProblemThe person that is building our aquariums says he will needaround six months to build all of the aquariums that we are wanting. Wereally want to be opened in the summer of 2014. The rough price estimate of theseaquariums is $88,000. Many large companies will only donate to non-profit organizations thatare tax exempt. We are waiting for the IRS to give us our tax exempt status, but have been told the soonest we could get it is January. So insteadof waiting, we are pursuing our goal to be opened by the summer. To do this weneed your help. Our SolutionTo raise some of these funds we decided to make shirts. We drew up some cool designs. These designs will only be available to our early kickstarter supporters. To show our appreciation of your early support, when you buy a shirt, and wear  it to the aquarium you will receive 50% off the entrance price. Anytime you come in with your shirt on you will receive 50% off, so buy one for each member of your family. The shirts are $20. Once we open up shirts like these will sell for $25 and no discount will be given. All proceeds of the shirts will go to the building of the aquarium. The only shirts that will have the 50% off discount will be the shirts with the shark, stingray, and jellyfish pictured on them. The plain EIA shirt will not come with the 50% off discount. When you purchase a shirt please tell us the size you would like. If you do not we will send you a large  Your SupportThe East Idaho Aquarium needs yourhelp! If we do not reach our goal, then we will not be able to bring theseawesome shirts to you, and we will have to put off opening the aquarium a fewmore months. This offer will only be available once. So tell everybody you know,and get one for all your family members. As you could tell from the video, we have the shirts already made. Once we get the funds we will go to our supplier, place the order, and send you your shirt. We have taken the necessary steps to eliminate most of the risks. The biggest challenge me may face is getting everything sorted and sent out. We have a dedicated team who we will meet all challenges and setbacks. We will find ways to deal with the challenges and make this project a success."
New LP Release by The Shape Of The Earth|successful|"""There’s something about them that is brutally honest- it speaks to you but doesn’t get forced on your ears. They clearly put their music first and worry about the rest second…"" - DysonSound.com.. We've done this before, and we need to do it again. 11 of the best songs we have ever written are just waiting for eager ears. So we did the research, talked with producers, recorded scratch after scratch and finally decided: In order to create a great sounding record like those we've created before, we need your help!  By help of course I mean:1. Studio Time - Despite getting great rates and free equipment rental, Casbah Studios needs to charge to stay in business.  By our most conservative estimates we can track the album at around 70 hours, putting us at the grand total of $3,500 for studio time and tracking.  2. Mixing/Mastering - Regardless of who we go to, this will run about $150/per track.  Seeing as we'll go through 13 tracks (a few are bound to be b-sides), this runs $2,000.3. Artwork - We've worked with numerous graphical artists and few have been as dependable and tuned to The Shape of the Earth's style as Tom B at manAlive.  He's ready to jump into the latest installment, but he has to make a living and charges us a fraction of what he charges his other clients (which include Radiohead, Target, and Columbia Records, to name a few). To design the record, CD jacket and other needs it comes to $500.4. Press  - Physical copies are on the way out, but we still get orders almost monthly for physical CDs not including press releases and venues that want old fashioned hard discs.  At a conservative pressing of around 500 copies the best quotes put this at $650. (and that's cheap).     Countless other costs creep up throughout the process (food, gas, guitar strings, etc) but we take care of those so we won't even tally them.  This brings us to a grand total of $6,650 for the album if we stick to the absolute minimum. If we can get this we'll deliver the ultimate in TSOTE records in just a few short months.  We've been scrimping and saving but we too have to eat and pay rent so we are able to come up with 35%, and we're looking to raise the remaining $4,500 through Kickstarter. Of course, more money would mean more polishing, extra studio time and ultimately a better record, but the rational meets hopeful at the 6 grand mark.In the past the one thing that's kept us going is support from you all, the listeners.  Whether it's comments on our Facebook page, YouTube videos set to our songs, or emails from overseas- it never ceases to amaze us how well the music resonates with people, and so we keep coming back. In advance here's a big huge THANKS.-Gavin, Kevin, Chris, Mark, Rich, The Shape Of The Earth       "
RinseKit: The Revolutionary Portable Shower|successful|How awesome would it be to clean up at the park or beach and rinse off the kids or dogs before they get in the car? That’s exactly why we created RinseKit, its like having a hose to go! RinseKit is the only portable shower to have the pressure of a garden hose without pumping or batteries.Now with your help, very soon it will also be the ONLY pressurized shower to have a battery-powered heater system that quickly and safely heats water to 100°F - A hot shower anywhere with the flip of a switch!   The RinseKit's patented design simply stores the water pressure from your home for later use. As the water pressure from your hose spigot enters the RinseKit, it compresses the air in the chamber. When you close the valve, that pressure is trapped in the RinseKit and acts like a spring to force the water through the hose and out of the nozzle.You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.PlayReplay with soundPlay with  sound00:0000:00      RinseKit’s patented design can hold the same pressure as a garden hose (55-75 psi) for over a month. When in use, RinseKit can spray for over 5 minutes depending on the nozzle setting.RinseKits are BPA-free, so they are safe to drink from and you can use its water for cleaning up after cookouts. There are also no moving parts and RinseKit is made of extremely tough virgin PE and ABS plastics. Additionally, RinseKit is made from materials that will not rust, so you don't have to worry about corrosion. it’s extremely durable.      RinseKit has six sprayer nozzle settings and a 6 foot long hose. The detachable lid also acts as a standing pad to rinse off dirty or sandy feet, a cutting board with inch marks for measuring fish and a handy seat. RinseKit can also store wet swimsuits, sunscreen and more under the lid.           Whether you’re cleaning up after hiking, surfing or work, just need to rinse your car or remotely water plants, RinseKit is like having a hose-to-go!Now you can wash your dog with warm water!Rinse off little feet after a day on the beach with the familyClean up after a lunchtime workout so you’re ready for work Wash the car without the restrictions of a stationary hoseUse while camping as a shower, to rinse off dishes or put out campfiresAnd much more…    You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.PlayReplay with soundPlay with  sound00:0000:00*Note: bike pump is not included  You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.PlayReplay with soundPlay with  sound00:0000:00                      Why Kickstarter? We are essentially a start-up company with big dreams. We hope to introduce RinseKit to people who live active lives and love to get dirty. Kickstarter is the perfect platform to reach a diverse group of people that are up on the latest trends and appreciate innovative design. We need help from the Kickstarter community to bring our heater accessory to life. From surfers to parents to dog owners to anyone that gets dirty, RinseKit offers the convenience and versatility to fit into Kickstarter backer’s lives. Thank you for helping to make our dream a reality. We’d love to hear your feedback, so please give us your thoughts in the comments section.US & International patents and patents pending 2102.0002-USDP-6   / 002637991-0001  /  30-2015-0008899 RinseKit-  We expect no delays with the delivery of RinseKit to our Kickstarter supporters. We will begin shipping June 3, 2016 . We are about to receive a large shipment and our production facility is standing by to keep up with demand. This product is built extremely well and we are confident that it will  provide you with many years of service. RinseKit Heater Accessory- We have been working diligently to develop the Heater Accessory for this Kickstarter campaign and we now have a working prototype that will heat cold water to 103 F max in approximately 30 minutes.  If we reach our Kickstarter funding goal, we will immediately begin engineering, tooling and full-scale manufacturing to deliver this game changing invention.Here’s what we see as the risks. MANUFACTURING: Creating the tooling to manufacture a product like this is expensive and requires expert knowledge to get it right. There is typically a 60 day lead time to create the molds for a product similar to this and that is one area where delays could occur. To minimize the possibility, we're working with a tooling manufacturer partner that has a superb track record for delivering high quality tools on time. PRODUCT ADJUSTMENTS: As the Heater Accessory gets readied for production, there will likely be some minor adjustments to improve the final product. Pre-production prototypes are made to test and refine the product and allow us to incorporate our adjustments and those suggested by our experienced manufacturing partners.  We do not expect delays. In the unlikely event that we have delay, we will keep you informed. We will also inform you any changes to the performance or specifications of this product. FULFILLMENT: Sometimes things go sideways that can’t be planned for; a supplier misses a deadline, a machine breaks down or a shipment gets delayed. These things could cause a delay. We have selected a factory with a very good track record of building this type of product, with deep experience creating heating elements and rechargeable batteries. We do not expect any significant manufacturing delays. If by chance we do experience a delay in manufacturing, we will keep you in the loop about it. We promise that we will not compromise the quality of the product to meet a deadline. Your pledge brings us one step closer to the goal of delivering the ultimate portable shower system. Please help us create this product by clicking the ‘Back This Project’ button at the top of the page. We would also really appreciate your help by sharing our Kickstarter page with your friends.  THANK YOU!
Singularity|failed|We are Plano-Convex, a collective of film, art, music, andcreative writing students at the University of Michigan. We are a team aimed atcreating quality, professional films. We are asking for your help in making a short film —SINGULARITY. This amazing project has been in development for several months,and we are nearing the end of the pre-production phase. We need your help totake the next step!As students, our tuition is allotted to film stock andequipment — but to pull this movie off, it will take a great deal of supportfrom the student and film communities. In supporting student filmmakers, youwill play an integral role, not only in bringing this film to fruition but alsoin helping us to become better filmmakers. SYNOPSIS:AELITA, a computer parts scavenger is down and out; thedregs of post-modern culture. A hardened life on the streets and her leachingboyfriend, OREN, makes her feel more apathetic with each passing day. Breakinginto a newly abandoned apartment building, she discovers the means by which toenter into the Cybernet via the enigmatic and mysterious computer-entity, ZOLA.A series of rash decisions makes Aelita enemies with local dealer andhot-headed lunatic, PREZ, who won't settle for less than to see Aelita and Orendead on the ground.  As Oren racesto find Aelita and escape the teeming megalopolis, Zola preaches to Aelita ofhis own newly-founded computer religion bent on mass (computer) suicide andtranscendence to the Cybernetic Ether. But when Prez comes to call, Aelita isforced to confront her own existence and make a case for her own agency.WHAT WE NEED:Funding for Locations. We are filming at a host of stunninglocations as close as Ann Arbor and as far away as Chicago. Fantastic locationslike these (unfortunately) require legitimate funding in return for theirservices. Funding for Travel. Gas money makes up about 40-60 percentof a student filmmaker's budget. Help us to put gas in the tank, and miles onthe road!Funding for Analogue Special Effects. We will be creatingmatte paintings, photographing miniatures, and setting up an in studio rig fora technique known as slit scanning.

"Calvin Thomas: Making the ""October Sky"" Album!"|failed|" Welcome to My Kickstarter!Hey everyone, my name is Calvin Thomas! I am a singer-songwriter from Maryland and I normally play covers and originals. Thanks for checking out my Kickstarter! Music has always been a part of my life, the good parts and the bad parts. And I want this album to manifest all of those parts into reality. This album is all about being good-natured, overcoming obstacles, and making a better life for yourself. And after I got numerous compliments from people about my original songs (including one from a friend that said it helped her get through dark days), I realized that I HAD to do this, not just for me but anyone who truly believes in the album's message.Hey guys. Don't mind me. Just sitting on this tree stump here.What I've Worked On So Far: Before I wanted to make an EP or album, I started with a single first. In October 2016, I released a single called A Better Day. It turned out to be the best thing I had ever done. And the weird thing about that is, I never thought I would ever release a song, EVER. But when I did, I felt overjoyed. AND, everyone that listened to it had nothing but good things to say about it, including that they wanted to hear more stuff from me. Works for me!And so, I started to prep an EP, 6 original tunes for your listening pleasure. But then, halfway through 2017, I decided that I would make an album instead. So many musician friends from Periscope influenced me from their own albums - I HAD to do it too, you know? I felt like you all would rather enjoy an album from me instead of an EP. So, as of today, I've been editing the demos I recorded for the EP piece by piece (some of these made it to my Soundcloud.) Gotta figure out which ones make it to the big leagues!Just strumming some chords. This is a GREAT photo - I feel like I'm actually watching the performance from here!Making ""October Sky"": The album title ""October Sky"" alone illustrates the essence of the album in a broad but positive way. From time to time, when I look at the sky, I remember good things that have happened in my life but I also think about the not so good things and how I've grown from both. I think it's a very relatable situation for many people - finding a way to make a better life for themselves. Not JUST through successes, but ultimately, learning from mistakes and becoming a well-rounded person. THAT is the meaning of October Sky.Goals: My initial Kickstarter goal is $8,000, which would help cover tracking, mixing, engineering, mastering, CD printing, and distribution. If we reach the 1st stretch goal of $10,250, I can record more songs for the album and possibly add special goodies? And if we reach $12,500 and beyond, then I can continue to record more and more songs, possibly tour to different places and perform my songs, and/or record a music video even.The next chapter begins. Thank you all for your support!Thank You!!At first I didn't think this was a possibility, that I could record music like this and challenge myself to reach greater heights. But then all of you WONDERFUL people came along and...well, things changed in the best possible way. You all push me to be better, and you all support me when I'm down. I'll always remember that.Thank you all VERY much for supporting my Kickstarter. Let's do this!One of the challenges is the time that it will take to record the album - specifically planning studio time. When I recorded A Better Day, I did all of that at home. But the album requires studio time from a bigger studio, and that can be a bit tricky sometimes."
Wilmer Wilson IV Summer Art Residency at NLS|successful|NLS is excited to host Wilmer Wilson IV as our first Summer artist-in-residence! NLS is a visual art initiative in Kingston Jamaica that facilitates experimentation and collaboration in visual art, connects artists to each other locally and internationally, and presents their work to the larger public. Having international artists work in Jamaica is an important part of NLS’ programming because while we grow the art scene locally we work towards a more connected global network of artists in which information is accessed openly.Wilmer is a talented artist whose workbridges performance, sculpture and collage. He will be working at NLS on his project Notes from June to August.  Notes is an expansion of his work in whichsculpture, anthropological research, and found objects, including found paper,  build to function as cultural archives.  Wilmer's project Notes offers us a uniqueopportunity to engage the rich but understated aspects of our environment, andthe insight that this overlooked visual information can provide.$2500 of the funds being raised will facilitate Wilmer purchasing materials for the project (such as staples, wood, stapleguns, paper, house paint, rental of a table saw and hardware) and cover Wilmer's travelexpenses and sleeping accommodations for the nine weeks of his residency and $250 will go towards Kickstarter processing fees. ALL of the funds raised will go towards Wilmer's project and event programming for his residency.Wilmer will be at NLS during hurricane season. Although we have never had any major catastrophes over the years, short term implications are loss of electricity, loss of water and potential flooding.  NLS has access to a generator that can be used for Wilmer's studio and NLS is located on premises that benefit from good drainage and higher elevation.  We also have water storage in case of emergency.
Gladys Sings|successful|I was inspired to write this book because of a friendship that started years ago, back in the 40’s, between my mother and a lovely young lady named Lucille. Lucille and my mother were college roommates and dreamed of one day getting married and having children, and that their kids would be friends too. After graduation, Lucille married George and lived with him on a farm in Indiana. They had a son and a daughter who just happened to be the same age as my brother and me; and so another friendship was born. Sadly, and much too soon, my mother passed away, but the friendship that I had with the Gobels remained strong. When I wrote to them, in some ways, it was like writing to my own mother; and when I saw Carol, it was like we had never grown up at all.So, Gladys Sings is a story of the Gobels farm, farmer Goble and his wife Lucille, and a lovely Hen named Gladys. After that, all connection with the Gobels seems to fly out the window as my imagination takes over and I lose myself in the story line of Gladys and how she wants to be an opera singer! And so the book, a tribute to the Goble family, morphs into a book about what we can achieve when we know ourselves well, have dreams, and enough imagination, courage, and support from our community, to make them happen. I am a psychotherapist and a writer. All of my stories combine my two passions, helping others and creative writing, to offer wisdom for children in a whimsical fashion that will delight even the big grown up kids! I know when I have written a great book…it’s when I get to the end, and I am crying tears of joy! Gladys Sings does that for me, and I know it will for you as well.And now for the sad news. The Gobels are facing a particularly challenging time in their lives. Farmer George and Lucille are both getting up in age and their daughter, my dear friend Carol, has just been diagnosed with two inoperable brain tumors. I need to give this book to them! When you love someone and they are hurting, you give of yourself to bring whatever relief you can to ease their pain. Gladys Sings was meant to be a gift for them. With your help, we can deliver this into their hands and let them know how much they are loved. Thank you so very much.As with any publishing projects, there may be challenges to deliver on time. If this does happen, then we will be sure to let you know what is causing the delay. As well as inform you of the new estimated date of completion.

After that, all left over revenue will go towards paying for web hosting and cost of analog materials. If there's any money left after that, I'm going to invest in a new laptop. My current one is a decade old and failing. Upgrading my computer will allow me to run better software and have more versatility in my work schedule thus resulting in better output.This is my third Kickstarter for the comic. I fulfilled the last two ahead of schedule with nary a hitch. I've got the process down pat, so unless something really crazy happens, like that I fund in enough volume to do off set instead of print on demand, I expect this Kickstarter shan't have any issues.

Through Your Door - Feature Film Finishing Funds|successful|In August 2011, I had a simple idea: what if you showed a home invasion from the invader's point of view? That started a very quick succession of events that cumulated in a small motley crew of family, friends and understanding strangers gathering in a Rhode Island mansion and shooting a full feature film in 12 days. The film, THROUGH YOUR DOOR, has been completely edited, but it's not finished. The purpose of this Kickstarter is to raise money to finish the film.

Decorative Oxygen Tank Bags by AmariJade, Inc.|failed|" Attractive Oxygen Tank Bags by AmariJade, Inc. (A patent pending item)Decorative Oxygen Tank Tote Bags - Travel Bags for your Oxygen Tank or Oxygen ConcentratorMy StoryGreetings Kickstarter Community! My name is Yvonne Humphries and I am a fashion designer of my company Amari Jade, Inc. I am a 63 year old grandmother with over 50 years of experience, and have learned my extensive hand making techniques from my grandmother from when I was a small child. I have made items such as wedding gowns, dress coats, men and women suits, tote bags, upholstered covers for furniture, etc., throughout my life. I have now originated my long-term craft into portable, attractive oxygen tank and concentrator bags for those who need to carry an oxygen tank or concentrator for medical purposes. The bags are also large enough to include a wallet, check book, bottle of water, keys, cell phone, etc; just as a purse would hold.  My decorative oxygen tank bag idea came about, a little over a year ago in 2012, after my elderly and stylish mother-in-law desired an attractive bag for her oxygen concentrator, that would also accommodate other carried items (cell phone, wallet, lipstick, bottled water); so that she would not have the burden of carrying two bags at once, her purse and the oxygen carrier. Since I was already making and selling tote bags, I wanted to provide the bag as a personal gift to her. I took the measurement of her oxygen concentrator and designed this bag which assisted her need. She loved it! It is a great convenience for her to shop and travel. But that was not the end of it! After my mother-in-law began to carry her new oxygen tank bag to and from her church, the hospital, as well as other public places, she received a plentiful amount of admiration along with inquiries as to where she received her bag. Since then, I have been taking orders for many of her friends and associates. Even a few of the nurses at her healthcare facility wanted to promote my oxygen bag idea to the hospital. Unfortunately this has been a challenge to advertise and sell in bulk, since I readily did not have numerous amounts produced in a such short notice. NOW MY BUYERS DO NOT HAVE TO CARRY AN OXYGEN TANK AND A PURSE! IT IS TWO IN ONE!!!SpecificationsMy oxygen tank bags are mostly made from an upholstery blend of fabric, for durability purposes. Within the bag there are several favorable compartments: -4 interior pockets, 1 with zipper pockets-4 exterior pockets-Flap back-closed-Brass Feet (convenient for sitting on floor)The bags are well padded and reinforced.As with my oxygen tank bag, I have started by creating the standard size of many required portable oxygen tanks that will suit the patient’s need; which is the standard size D, also newly known as M-15 oxygen cylinder tank. This size in particular will be the bulk of what I will have manufactured. The average measurements of my bags are 15 1/2 Height x 7 Width x 4 Diameter (or Depth). The strap is a 18 inch drop, and 2"" wide.I will also produce the other several sizes of the oxygen cylinder tank: -	Jumbo D (M-22) -	C (M-9) -	M-7 -	B (M-6) The sizes for the oxygen concentrator bags are made according to the average small to medium sizes of the actual concentrator; which will also be produced in bulk.All of these specified cylinder tank sizes require a carrier bag. The price for the bags will only be $69.00 to $89.00 per bag (prices will more than likely decrease once manufactured). Targeted AudienceIndividuals:According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are currently 64 million individuals worldwide with Chronic Objective Pulmonary Disease (also known as COPD) and many of those patients are required to carry a portable oxygen tank or concentrator, for oxygen treatment and therapy (12.7 million are in the US). Worldwide medical oxygen systems market for home healthcare has been minimally impacted by the recession, due to the sustained demand for home oxygen therapy from the elderly. The much needed oxygen therapy industry has a current global market for $1.18 billion; therefore, those who require a carrier for the oxygen tanks or concentrator, the bag serve as a purpose for a medical need. The majority of my targeted customers are women. Out of all of the effected individuals with COPD, 37% more are females, than males. Today, most of the oxygen carrier bags are a simple, plain, and dark colored nylon bag with a Velcro fasten. Most of the individuals, especially women, love to carry a fashionable bag accessory that will aid and mask their tank or concentrator necessity; “unlike a typical carrier that is a bland and dull” ~ as one of my customers have quoted. Many of the effected individuals have even refused to carry their tank or concentrator at all because of its’ “stigmatic” appearance in public, of their much needed medical equipment. This will lead to even more of a health risk and it will also have a negative affect socially, for those who choose to rarely leave their home.Groups/Associations:Business associations within healthcare that specialize in respiratory care are also my targeted market for my oxygen tank/concentrator bag. As stated before, there have been many individuals of the healthcare staff who are interested in learning more about how to purchase my handmade creation in bulk for their establishment. This includes general hospitals, respiratory therapy organizations (i.e. Lung Associations, Thoracic Society groups, etc.) and medical supply establishments worldwide.

She was so kind and helpful. This bag is perfect in every way. She sized it to fit my tank with extra room for ""purse"" things I want to carry with me. The material is wonderful and the little things she put on the bottom keep it from falling over. It's just so great that someone has come up with this idea for those of us that are on oxygen, still able to go out and about but want some style. I just still don't have any idea how she made it so quickly and got it to me within a few days and for it to meet my exact needs. God Bless her.""  ~ Judith""I ordered the oxygen tank cylinder bag as a Christmas gift for my mother. She has always been a classy lady, as most women from her generation were. She is ashamed to carry the ""ugly"" bags from the oxygen supply store. This bag is a neutral color, it looks like a purse or tote bag, and is very durable. There is nothing else on the market that compares to it. I have searched. I know she will be proud to carry this very classy looking bag. Thank you Yvonne!"" n nSnoopy32"" ~ nSnoopy32Please help me with this business venture. I cannot do this without your help!! Thank you in advance for your contributions, Yvonne HumphriesLaunch ChallengesAs I am overly excited for my new business venture! However, I am experiencing the hardships of getting older, lacking the speed and energy I once had as a younger person. As orders come in, it is taking me an extensive amount of time to produce the bags by myself, as they have a variety of intricate measures upon completion, which is why the bag is unique, compared to others. I also lack the industrial machinery, that will speed up the process and that will handle the sewing of the tougher fabrics (i.e. leather material). Another challenge is that my eyesight is deteriorating…I have had eye cataracts surgery, severe nearsightedness and black, circular eye floaters, which has progressed over the years. All of the eye disorders that I have are obstructing my view more and more as time goes on.I have handmade each and every individual bag that I have sold. Since each bag takes a minimum of a full day or two to produce, I have simply been unable to meet the demands of my customers. I now require a manufacturer to produce my bags, which I currently have set up and ready to produce once I have the financial support. The demand of producing my bag has been a challenge with financing the advertisement and offering the variety of sizes and colors that I would like to showcase to my customers, who are eager for something new."

Behold The Uprising EP|failed|Making music is what we love doing, but making music is the easy part. We don't need a producer, label, manager, etc, etc. All we need to do is get the 5 of us in a room and just do what we do. But as much as we love this we need more, we need to get our music out into the world for our fans and for those who have never heard us.We already have the drive, ideas, songs, direction, creativity, and a plan. But being a local band and still working to get on our feet, we often lack the funds when all the other pieces to the puzzle are in place. Now this is where all of you come into play, we can create and write music on our own but we need your help to make the dream of recording and releasing our first EP a reality. With the aid of your generous support we will be able to produce, record, and manufacture our first release as a band. We have created a wide range of fun prizes to spice up and encourage donations of any amount. Prizes range from hugs, wristbands  and copies of the EP to dinner with the band, guitar lessons, guest vocal spots, and even the chance to have your face on the CD art and the EP named after you. So be sure to check out the all rewards to see the full scope of what we have to offer and what best suits you. We appreciate every cent that we receive because every penny comes form someone like you who supports us, our music and local music and musicians. We would like to say thank you to all our supporters and with your help we want to put out an amazing record!  Our biggest challenge is going to be deciding what songs will make it on the record and what songs will be left off. We are always coming up with new ideas, so come studio time we will need to discuss, debate and deliberate on what songs we believe are the best of the best. That being said the other challenge will be finding the right talent for the recording  of this album. We at the moment do not have a studio booked. So as the kickstarter is live we will be searching for local, or not so local places and people in search of someone who will be the best fit for us and will be able to help us record, manufacture and release an amazing EP!

Knot App|failed|There's several way to sell your stuff online and buy from others, but none are particularly great. Craigslist is full of scammers and you never know who you'r talking to, eBay has too many fake products from China and other listings apps like OfferUp and Wallapop work, but don't do much beyond that.Knot is the first app that lets you buy and sell locally and around the country (US only) with just a few taps. Upload your own picture, add a description, and we'll automatically show your listing to people around you, and to people who have expressed an interest in similar items (coming soon!).Not only is Knot the easiest, fastest way to buy and sell, but its also the most enjoyable. With a beautiful design and integrated leaderboards and gameified rewards, shopping on your phone will actually feel fun!We've already built our first version of the app, and will be releasing on the App Store mid-March. We need your help to help us pay server costs for the first couple months.We also have a site: http://www.knotcomplex.comQ: How is that enough money to start a real business?A: We're not supporting ourselves off this app yet, all the members of our team also have part time or full time day jobs. The number used for this project was based off supporting 30,000 users for six months with our current server costs. That's long enough that we could then get VC support to start getting enough money to hire developers and marketing teams and such. Your rewards will always be there though!Q: Where will this be available?A: We're going to do a soft launch in the San Francisco Bay Area this March, and then in April (when the kickstarter ends) we're gonna expand to the rest of the US.Q: How do you know you can compete with established players?A: Building the app is no issue, in fact it's almost already done. Managing a backend for data storage and in-app messaging is handled by our providers, we just plug in. During the initial launch we'll have a pre-stocked store and once several thousand users have signed on, they will be uploading their own stuff.Q: Can you scale to thousands of users?A: That's why we're scaling our release. Once we know that we can handle just the area where we live then we'll expand to make sure server and data capacities will be sufficient.

Centennial Armenian Genocide T-Shirt|failed|Help us raise enough money to start screen printing these T-Shirts so we can start selling them and raise awareness for the Armenian Genocide. This year marks the 100th Anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, so this is a very important to Armenians and their descendants worldwide. All your pledges will towards printing these shirts and getting the word out the public about it. Every dollar is appreciated.                                     MEANING OF ARTWORK ON SHIRTThis shirt is made to recognize the centennial of the Armenian Genocide in memory of the 1.5 millions Armenians who were slaughtered. The tree on the front of the shirt symbolizes the Armenian nation, and it’s red roots represent the blood of our ancestors who were killed in 1915. The names of the territories with mass killings are written on these roots.  The quote “Do Not Let A Genocide Go Unrecognized In Your Lifetime,” is a cry for the world to acknowledge and accept the Armenian Genocide. This shirt is telling us to come together and take a stand against massacre. We should, we MUST, speak out against genocide. Don’t wait any longer and accept the genocide now.  On the back of the shirt, the slogan “I Remember & I Demand,” is dedicated to the 100th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide. “The slogan is specifically emphasized and individualized so that every time we say those words, we remember the stories of our families and the tragedy that we Armenians experienced and present the demand that we see in this context to the whole world.”  According to the authors, the symbol of the Armenian Genocide Monument “Tsitsernakaberd” is meant to “be a sprout of plant which has torn the cover of pain and got out, symbolizing the will to live and the idea of nation’s revival. Partly split vertically by a deep crevice, this tower symbolizes the tragic and violent dispersion of the Armenian people, and at the same time, expresses the unity of the Armenian people. Lastly, a basalt stone lies on the floor of the outdoor hall, symbolizing the eternal memory of the victims of the Tragedy and the unity of the Armenian people spread throughout the world. “The challenges we face after getting funded is selling these and getting the word about these shirts out to the local Armenian communities.
mini flashlights and fire starters|failed|Mini Flashlights and Fire PistonsWhy would somebody want one or need one?   In many Circumstances, these two tools would be a considerable help.  The mini flashlight is small and lightweight and will fit on a keyring without adding excess weight and bulk.  In dark areas or at night, it will help you see.  It will not illuminate like a larger flashlight, but it will help you find a keyhole in the dark.  If your trunk or hood of your car has no light, you can use it to navigate these areas.  I keep a box in my trunk for emergencies, and I keep a larger flashlight in there.  But, my trunk has no light, and if I'm not careful, I can get cut on some of the sharp tools in that box.  The mini flashlight Helps me get the tools I need without getting injured. I do not smoke, so I do not carry a book of matches or a lighter.  There have been many times that I have needed to make a fire and have not had a spark to make one.  The fire piston will make the  spark, and you do not have to worry about keeping it dry or fueled.  It is small and lightweight, so it fits in a pocket or kit easily.  You can attach it to anything you wish.  It comes with six inches of parachord, so you can tie it to virtually anything.  My goal is to make pieces that are pleasing to the eyes, but I feel they should be functional as well.  Almost everything we own is functional.  If it does not serve a purpose in our house, it collects dust.  After awhile, my wife gets tired of cleaning it, and it goes away.  Anything that serves a purpose, stays with us.  My wife hates when I bring new tools home.  After they get used, or after she has had to use them, she has a respect for them.  She balked at these two items until she used them.  Now, they are a part of her kit as well as mine.The challenges I face are minimal.  Time and materials to make the objects, are the first challenge.  Materials are easy to come by, but shipping this time of year can be delayed by up to a week.  I have plenty of time, but sometimes emergencies arise and may slow me down for a day or two at most.  I have checked on the designs to ensure that I am not  infringing on a patent.
"""It's bigger on the inside"""|failed|"My DreamI'm trying to achieve a VR environment that immerses the user completely into whatever this system is being used for. While projects like Palmer Luckey's Oculus Rift just engage one's sight and hearing, my hope is to make a more complete sensory experience.Your probably asking"" Why not use a Oculus Rift. Simple. The Oculus only engages your eyes and ears. B.O.T.I is a full immersion system. What the eyes see and the ears hear, the mind believes. Add in a silent fan system to generate breezes and you can engage the sense of touch.My goal is to build a sphere of bendable screen. Use a rigid frame for support. Floor will need to be see through Gorilla Glass so the perfect sphere is intact. Any notable edges will distract from the overall effect. Separate the sphere into four different zones aka screens. Multiple screen systems are nothing new. This just takes it to a whole new level.This is the system for the monitors. So lets break this down into it basic parts.Outer ShellThis is where the whole box part comes in. The outer shell could be anything the user wants it to be. A miniature castle, a walk-in fish tank,...a phone box...Go nuts. It can be whatever you want it to be. Make it out of what ever you want. 3D printed plastic, wood, even metal. It will be yours to do with as you please.Geodesic Dome FrameThe Frame of the B.O.T.I box will consist of 20 curved triangles that will come together to create the enclosed sphere shape. Steel beams placed around it will create a box shape around the sphere for the users outer shell to be placed on. The triangles will be curved and about 3.5 feet in length. Will be made of good old fashioned wood.Inner ShellThis is where the magic will happen. Imagine a 7 foot space that you walk into and suddenly it seems like you are somewhere else.The screen saver could be a still with a 360 degree camera of your favorite place or even a looped video. The object of this is to make you feel like you are in a space that is bigger than it actually is.This is also why I am asking so much. The frame and outer shell will combined will probably cost around $15,000-20,000 at the most. The screens, computers and other electronic parts are what will be expensive. Look up a 77"" curved t.v  and you will understand why I am asking so much. For the prototype it will take 22 curved t.v's. The Bendable t.v's, I'm sure will be even more expensive.HardwareThe hardware is fairly straight forward. So lets make a little list shall we.Screens to make up the environmentSurround sound speakers for soundSilent fans for airflow, heck maybe throw in a few scented plugins that get powered based on what is in the ""perceived"" environment.HDMI Cords to connect all the screens and speakers togetherKinect sensors or the equivalent IR or galvanic wristbands for finer controls.A couple of high end computers. I saw one here on kickstarter that sounds like it might be perfect for the B.O.T.I Box. This is just a small list but I am sure you can get the picture. All readily available, they just need to be combined with the right software and i am sure that it could lead to a spectacular end.SoftwareThis is where it is going to get a little tricky. For a system like this it will have to be made mostly from scratch. I do have programming experience from my college time. Enough to know that i am going to need qualified and good help to make a good interface. I am more than willing to put in the leg work and effort to make this a reality. Lets be honest, this will be the brain of the whole system. It will be my baby. It will be worth every second if I can just find the right people to help properly design and code it. Any one reading this. Let me know if you know anyone and i mean anyone who could be a good fit for this. So lets make another list of what would be needed.Multi-screen system- This is nothing new. This part should not be a problem at all to get done.Sound-Again nothing new. Find the right programmers to work together, and this could be knocked out quickly. Currently another fellow  kickstarter here has agreed to do this part if successful. Go check out his project at https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/721912698/rpas-real-perception-audio-simulationKinect Sensor- Thankfully, Microsoft has a developer kit just for this kind of thing. Thank you so much to all the people at Microsoft who set that up. Silent Fans-Again, should be easy considering you only need to control the power to the individual units. The trick will be creating the algorithm to make it seem realistic.IR/Galvanic sensor- I have read a lot about research into these new sensors. If asked, I am sure the researchers over at MIT, Princeton or Microsoft will at least talk to me. A point in the right direction would be all I need. 360 ProgramsThese already exist. I intend to contact the people of some of the companies that work specifically in this area, and see if any of there products could take care of a big chuck of the software needs. If it doesn't exist, than we can make it exist. So....ONWARD!!!Final productFor input, we need three Kinect sensors to triangulate the user's movements and to receive voice commands. Eye monitoring software would be a plus. Add in IR wristbands to track individual finger movement. As such, One's own bodily movements could be the basic controls and the fingers would be the finer controls. The wristbands already exist with multiple places researching their use. Microsoft at http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-19884218 as well as MIT http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28349073. That just to name a few of the names researching possible uses for this technology.The Bendable TV showed off at CES this year by LG, would be perfect for this project. According to LG, they feel confident they can have a 70' bendable tv available for sale by 2017. Here, have a look see and understand what I mean at this link http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28245659This is my dream for the final project. For starters, I only want to create the core part of the B.O.T.I box. The 360 degree space. Once i have a fine tuned proto-type. Than we can add in the bendable screens to make a true box that seems bigger on the inside.Possible usesThe amount of possible uses for this are staggering. That's just with what I could think up. Once others get a hold of this kind of device. Who knows what could be accomplished. So how about another list? Why not!U.A.V a.k.a Drones-Put a 360 degree camera on a drone and pilot it with your own movements. Ever had the dream where you can fly? Well, this is a step closer to that.Virtual Vacation- Set it up so you are having a picnic at the beach in the comfort of home. Football Games-Come on, you all saw this one coming.Gaming-You move and your character moves with you. You talk, your character talks. Anything you do, all the way to scratching your nose, could carry over into your game.Phone calls or conference calls- With the camera's and microphones, Skype could go to a whole new level. Short of actually touching someone, you could potentially talk to someone like they are right there with you. Add in a 360 camera's, you could see where they are or vice a versa.Virtual Work space-If you work in a cubicle, why not work in a B.O.T.I Box. Your boss could watch your work and you could still talk to everyone at work.The list could go on....and on....If you believe like I do that this could be a potentially great thing, please donate. Even if its only $5.00, It would be very much appreciated. The biggest risk to this venture, is ensuring that all parts meet a certain standard of safety. If any part is deemed unsafe, the project will be dead in the water until the issue is fixed. It has to be safe or it defies the whole point of this project.The biggest challenge will be in programming the user interface. The individual elements have already been accomplished and shown to work. However, none of the elements have been combined in this way before. This will require rigorous testing to get all the bugs out.Next to that will be the needed processing power. For it to be even semi believable as a ""real"" space, it will need to be in the highest definition possible. For the pro-to-type, I think 1080 DPI that comes with most standard flat-screens will be plenty. For the space to be believable it will need to render at this kind of high quality. As any gamer will tell you, this eats up processing power and needs a high grade graphics cards.Apart from all that will be the cost of making it and testing it. I've done the math, and altogether is what i am asking for. This includes kickstarter reward fee's."
Jordon Bould Butcher Blocks|successful|"Walnut, Cherry, and Hard Maple are three of the most commonly used woods for butcher blocks because of their beauty, density, and durability. Both the end grain and long grain blocks can be refinished after years of use to restore their original beauty.Long grain blocks are great for everyday use, and show the grain running continuously through the length of the block.  End Grain gives a much more durable cutting surface which will never dull your knives. These show the beauty in the wood grain and are very rich in color.Care and Maintenance: Blocks should be scrubbed with warm soapy water and rinsed in the sink.  They should never be soaked in water or ran in the dishwasher.  Blocks should be treated with mineral oil or butcher block conditioner, both found at home improvement stores for about $10.  With heavy use, apply oil monthly, with moderate to light use apply every 6 -12 months.  All blocks have been conditioned  before shipping and are ready for immediate use.**Message me if you would like the finger grips on the ends and/or the juice groove (no extra cost)**End grain mapleEnd grain mapleLong grain cherryEnd grain cherryEnd grain cherryLong grain walnutEnd grain walnut13""x18"" Walnut and maple checkerboard pattern w/juice groove3/4"" Thick Maple and Walnut cutting board with a Cherry accent3/4"" Thick Walnut cutting board with Maple accentsMaple and walnut business card holdersWhat the new shop will do-Provide a professional atmosphere to meet with clients -A large organized space will increase production and reduce project times -Furniture productionEnd grain hard maple table with red oak rail.

SoMo: The Mixtape|failed|"Team SoMo,“SoMo: The Mixtape"" is more than just your normal, put out some tracks to “get hype”, mixtape.It is going to be a FREE mixtape, full of songs that are Pop, Hip-Hop, and R&B - all influenced from music heard around the world. In order for this to happen, we need #teamsomo to unite, harder and stronger than any group of fans ever have.At the moment, my team and I, can not commit the time we need and want, in order to give #teamsomo the type of quality and heart-felt emotion the music has to have. So, I’ve created this Kickstarter in order to gain the necessary funds needed in order to the complete the mixtape, videos, and everything else that comes with it.  #teamsomo has already given me so much and I can’t thank y’all enough – but now that I have the worlds attention from singing other artists' songs, it's time to show that I myself, am an artist, with a head full of words and a heart made to sing them.  Sincerely,  SoMo"
The Little Women Graphic Novel Project|failed|"UPDATE!Reward ImprovementsIn an effort to gather a bit more funding in the final few days, I have decided to UPGRADE all rewards. I'm unable to modify the actual reward descriptions, so please note the following:Any ""pencil drawing"" reward will now be upgraded to full color watercolor sketches.The $35 reward will now include a pencil sketch in addition to the print.If funding succeeds and for some reason you do NOT want a watercolor sketch, but want the pencil sketch you originally pledged for, just let me know when I send out the surveys.Thanks!GOAL: To make a Little Women graphic novel and get it published.THE PROJECT:I'm going to self-publish an exclusive comic/sketchbook containing several finished chapters from Little Women and some concept art. It will be a minimum of 80 pages, paperback, perfect bound. The book will be available to the public only through this Kickstarter. I will not be selling it afterwards.I will then use the book to pitch the full graphic novel to a publisher.For full info about the project, and more images and updates beyond the Kickstarter, please visit my website at http://danidraws.com/little-women/.ABOUT ME: My name is Dani. I am a children's illustrator and have been published in picture books, magazines, comics, and mobile apps (see danidraws.com). My picture book Monsters Vs. Kittens was recently published by Stan Lee's Kids' Universe, and my next book with them is already in the works. I also like to share and publish stories on my own. I keep an ongoing webcomic at mysisterthefreak.com, and I've written a few short stories, like frostythegourdman.com. You can read some of my other stuff at danidraws.com/stories.SAMPLE PAGESThese are some finished pages that I drew. They may or may not show up in the finished book, because I'm still planning out the script, page count, and format. However, they are very representative of what it might look like.WHERE THE MONEY GOESMoney from Kickstarter will mainly pay for book printing, shipping of the Kickstarter rewards, fees, and taxes. The book will be paperback, perfect bound. I am aiming for a minimum of 80 pages of comics and concept art. Remaining funds, if any, will help me as I take several months off of freelance work to concentrate solely on this project.The book will be exclusive to this Kickstarter. I will not be selling it afterwards. However, I will post select pages and art online on my website at danidraws.com/little-women.THE PLANIf funding succeeds, I will create the book and use it to pitch a full graphic novel to publishers. If it gets published, I will have YOU all to thank for getting it started! And even if it doesn't get picked up, you and I will still get a nice book out of it.If funding does not succeed, I will still complete the pitch on my own, but I won't be printing any books. I will still post process art and sample pages online.Timeline: If the Kickstarter is successful, I am planning to take a few months off of freelance work and concentrate solely on getting the book done. My goal is to have them printed before the end of the year, so you should receive them early 2013.Just to be clear, the book I am funding through this Kickstarter will not be the entire graphic novel, but only a few chapters and concept art. That being said, I am going to make this as ""complete"" a book as possible. If you are unfamiliar with Little Women, it is very episodic in nature. Each chapter is like it's own little short story, so my hope is that this book will feel more like a collection of stories and not like an incomplete part of a larger whole.Why not just make the entire graphic novel?To create the full novel at the quality it deserves, Kickstarter backers would probably be waiting six months to a year for their rewards, and I didn't want to do that. I considered finishing the whole thing before running the Kickstarter, but at the rate I'm going in between freelance work and other projects, it probably wouldn't see the light of day for years.However, by self-publishing a smaller sample, I can provide you with a nice book within a few months, while still furthering my goal of finding an outside publisher than can support a full graphic novel.WHY I WANT TO DRAW THE LITTLE WOMEN GRAPHIC NOVELIn short, it is my favorite book. Ever. I have been in love with Little Women since I was a teenager. I have two sisters of my own, so I very much related to story of the March sisters and their various trials as they grew up.Part of my collection. Yup, this is my favorite book.I think it is a shame that Little Women hasn't gotten as much attention over the years as other beloved kid/teen stories like Peter Pan, Alice in Wonderland, Pride & Prejudice, Lord of the Rings, and Treasure Island, which have all been adapted in various books, comics, and movies. To bring Little Women to a new audience, I think there is a demand and need to make a graphic novel version that is accessible and attractive to kids (and distinguishing adults).SOME NOTES ABOUT REWARDSAll international orders (outside the U.S.) that require shipping, please add an additional $15.To add another book to any tier, simply add $20, and write a note to me so I know you are buying another book and not simply raising your donation.All books, prints, and art come signed.Rewards! Examples of the print and 5x7 pencil drawing.UPDATES AND EXTRAS!Live video stream. Watch the project launch and other live events! I'll draw pages from the book or backer rewards, and giveaway goodies to viewers.Watch, chat, and view the full schedule at danidraws.com/danidrawslive or the Ustream channel page at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/dani-draws.Updates. Throughout the project, I will regularly post about my progress with behind-the-scenes peeks, process, and news. You can follow along in a number of ways:Right here on this Kickstarter pageThe process blog on my own website at danidraws.com/little-women/updatesFollow me on Twitter and/or FacebookSOME FINAL WORDSI created this Kickstarter project because I'm excited to share this with you all, and want to get a book available to the public in some way. However, whether this succeeds in its funding or not, my main goal is to simply promote the idea and get readers excited for a Little Women graphic novel. So even if you can't contribute in a financial way, I would still appreciate any efforts you can do to spread the word or advocate the eventual publishing of the full graphic novel! (You can start by leaving a comment of support on this page.)Thanks in advance for all your help!"

We have 4 days to go and the project is fully funded! What a victory! Woohoo!  Thanks to everyone who donated. Need I say more? Actually...YES! So here goes...  http://youtu.be/HJCOfXQU7IIUPDATE 2Hey all! Just finished brainstorming T-shirts for the $50 level.  This is the basic design but I need your help to vote for the wording. There are a few variations of this image. So please vote on your favorite and that will be printed. UPDATE 1hey folks! i just wanted to share the first update video of the project.  We spent 6 days in NYC tracking drums, bass, and working on song structures. This is just a brief video that will give you a look into the process.  THANK YOU for your support!  I really can't make this happen without you :)========================================================WHO AM IMy name is Joy Ike and I love people! I love music too! I create music to reach the hearts of people, to create lasting and worthwhile change in our world, and to do what God has made me to do!WHAT I DO and WHYI travel, I perform at universities, coffeehouses, theaters, churches, clubs, listening rooms, music festivals, special events, and art festival. I talk to middle school and high school students. I write real songs about real things.  I am passionate about what I do. I am passionate about connecting with people through the arts. I am passionate about creating lasting change in our communities through the arts. I believe that the arts are a lifeline to community revitalization. I believe words, when shared thoughtfully, and with love and conviction, are powerful and can change a heart.  I just want to live my life fully alive!  And I am about to record my 3rd Full-length album! And I can barely wait!A LETTER FOR YOUDear Friends!The time has come!   As I write to you, I'm currently overflowing with so much anticipation. I am truly, truly excited for the things to come even though I don't exactly know what they are . I am 3 weeks away from starting a brand new project and have been writing these songs for nearly 2 years now.  This album will be a bit different. It will be produced by Saul Simon of The Lovely Light studio in NYC.  It will be a album of primarily love songs. And i don't know how to say this except that ""I put alot of tears into this album.""  This album and its songs hold a very special place in my heart and i really want to share them with the world...and YOU!This album, in full, will take roughly $10,000 to record. $8,000 seemed like a good place to start when recording the video, but after the doing the math, it was necessary to set my Kickstarter goal at $10,000. The funds will be well be spent on producer, musicians, tracking, mixing, mastering, CD duplication, and rewards for funders.  You can bet that I will put ever last cent to good use!My ""ask"" is that you would support this venture and that you would tell the people in your networks about it, in return for some incredibly, excellent rewards(look to your right)!   And the biggest reward is that you can finally stop asking me ""So hey, when do we get to hear your new stuff?""  :)Thank you all for your support and encouragement over the last 7 years and to God be the glory in all that we do!-Joy“We all die.

Bohemian Book Project|successful|Objective: To raise $3,000 (or more!) for travel, research, and the making of the Bohemian Book Project at ArtMill, a not-for-profit international arts center and sustainable farm, in south central Bohemia.Conceptual framework:The Bohemian Book Project is an illustrated children’s book about the relationship between art and the environment.  We will explore folk tales from the Czech Republic where there is a rich tradition of oral storytelling.  Using our individual backgrounds in the visual (Amia) and performing arts (Miriam), we are modernizing a traditional tale to address current issues about the environment and sustainability.  Our book will combine visually stunning designs with narrative to demonstrate how the earth is its own natural source of art and how we can “use the power of the land, the water and even technology to engender more creative and sustainable human problem-solvers.”* At ArtMill, we will talk to local Bohemians about the history and stories from their region, take photographs, compose the illustrations, and start a dialogue with other international artists about their own relationships to the environment. Why ArtMill?“ArtMill borders the Šumava region, a unique and protected nature reserve and forest ecosystem.  Behind the Iron Curtain for 40 years, large portions of the area were stripped of human settlement and today it's considered the most extensive forest in the region.”* We both had the opportunity to work and teach at ArtMill in the summer of 2010, and we were greatly inspired by the history of the region, natural beauty of the land, and the artistic community dedicated to sustainable creative practices.Practical:The children’s book will combine text with full-page illustrations. The illustrations will be a combination of photography, collage, and drawing using natural found objects and recycled or reclaimed materials. The format of the illustrations will be still life photographs taken at ArtMill, which we will print and manipulate using ink and pigment to create a multi-media layered effect. The book will be approximately 32 pages long with 2 to 5 lines of text per page. We would like to print on recycled paper using sustainable practices in the book industry. Destination: Upon finishing the book, we would like to exhibit large format prints of the book’s illustrations in a gallery as well as publish and sell the book in bookstores. Goal:To create fun and stimulating material for children that drives awareness for the environment and encourages artistic exploration. Our project seeks to revive the Czech Republic’s rich tradition in storytelling by experiencing the natural world through the arts*www.artmill.eu
The Viking Hood - Alive and Kicking!|successful|"Klesarven.no (The Nordic Clothing Heritage Co.) is a new entrepreneur in Norway who create clothes inspired by viking age (790- 1066) based on research and interpretation. The Hood is a high quality product, made so you can choose to wear a lovely historical garment instead of a cheap costume from China made of cotton (witch is bad for the environment and the vikings did not have it either).  Now you can get yourself a hood that you might have seen a lot lately, thinking about the ""Vikings"", ""The last Kingdom"" and of course the new Norwegian film ""Birkebeinerne"".  The hood is suitable for all viking and early medieval festivals/events, reenactment, LARP, cosplay, and the best part; a modern lifestyle!  A hood for those of us who care for sustainable clothing from eco-friendly fabrics, our nordic heritage and the love of viking art and styles. Everything new has it´s roots in the well-forgotten old and when we dress up in viking clothes today, it helps us to bring history closer. I want all viking entusiast to experience the powerful feeling of what its like to wear a viking garment made with high quality.  FREE SHIPPING!  That is a great value for you!THE FABOULUS HOOD! Now lets talk about the man in the marsh. This hood is inspired by the Norwegian Skjoldehamn hood, as described by Dan Halvard Løvlid (2009). It was found on a body in a marsh on the island of Andøya, Norway, near the harbour of Skjold, and is dated around 1050 to 1090. Photo: Dan Halvard Løvlid.The hood is made of three squares of wool – the main square and two gores that are roughly half that dimension. The gores are sewn onto the front and back, rather than the sides, as would usually be expected by modern standards. Why?  To keep the rain away, brilliant! There are no buttons or zippers.  We make the hoods sustainable by using wool and linen, just like the vikings did. Easy to put on and pull off. REWARD/PRODUCT #2 AND #3VIKING HOOD BASIC !Choose between 4 sizes:  Children 2-6 years,  Kids 7- 12,  Adult Medium,  Adult LargeWOOL: Choose between Ice blue, green, brown, yellow, red or dark purple. LINEN:  Choose between natural fine, natural medium, light blue, brown, red and blue. REWARD/PRODUCT # 4 AND # 5VIKING HOOD REVERSIBLE !  Choose between 4 sizes: - Children 2-6 years,  Kids 7- 12,  Adult Medium,  Adult Large1. First: choose between LINEN with LINEN or WOOL with LINEN ! 2. Wool colors available: Ice blue, green, dark brown, yellow, red, blue or dark purple.3. Linen colors available: linen natural, light blue, brown, red or blue. MATERIALS & WHO MAKES THE HOODS.Our hoods are made from 100% linen and 80- 97 % wool. Both linen and wool fabric are woven and made in Europe.  A group of expert tailors in Basque Country, Spain, are making most of the linen- and reversible hoods. http://www.dobentextil.comIf you want 100 % wool let me know and I might be able to find a good woven fabric.  Some of the basic wool hoods are proudly Made in Norway as I am trying to make them as local as I can! The reason is that I want to explore different production model before I have more hoods made. SIZES, FOR MEN & FOR WOMEN? The cut is the same for male and female.  All hoods are unisex. The adult size medium is good size for women and the adult size large goes well to male vikings with wider shoulders. BUT it depends of course how you like it. If you want it to be a loose fitting hood with lots of room for big long hair and lots of viking gear, go for the big one.  	•	The children size 2-6 years measure  47 cm ( 18,5 inches) - face opening.  •	The Children size 7-12 years measure 58 cm (22,8 inches) - face opening. •	The adult size Medium measure 63 cm  (24,8 inches) - face opening.        •	The adult size Large measure 65 cm (25,6 inches) - face opening.  THE PROJECT AND FUTURE PLANSI started klesarven.no in may 2015 with imports and are ready to take the next step by making my own collection of high quality historical garments inspired by viking age. I hope you will help me make it happen. The kickstarter project will help me to order a large number of hoods the get a good price. Producing sustainably also means avoiding over-stock and the making of products nobody wants.  Better for the environment and no left overs to be thrown away! This campaign will give me a feedback on the products and opens up for communicating with you who share the love of viking heritage art and style.  If the project turns out a success I will start my journey looking for resellers as well as offering the hoods at a permanent basis in my own web store. Can´t wait!   FOLLOW US!We are on Facebook, Pinterest and Instagram. https://www.facebook.com/klesarven.no/https://www.instagram.com/klesarven/https://no.pinterest.com/klesarven/And the web site of course: (Her kan du også lese mye av teksten på norsk:)http://klesarven.noANY questions, please contact me and I will answer as soon as I can.  If you somehow need another color on the basic wool hoods I will try my best to make you happy!  All photos by Bente Johansen.  Taken at Kaupang, Norway. Big hug to you Bente and our gorgeous models.  Special thanks to Bjørg who made this shoot happen!  Embroidery work in progress, just add 200 nok and I will make it for you on your hood!  Viking hoods on TV! There is a risk of delays in the manufacturing process as well as with the overseas shipping + customs. However, the rewards should be in your hands in april as the manufacturer has told us that they need 20 days starting about 15. march. Then I need 1-2 weeks for shipping depending on how far from Norway you live. I will start production as soon as we reach a 100 %! Also, we might run out of wool fabrics in some of the colors. If so I will contact you and show you a good similar other one. There is a chance you have to pay duties to your government for importing our product.  Also, since you can not try our hood, there is a risk that it might not fit perfectly.  The wool fabric might shrink about 5 % but the linen is made of pre washed fabric and will not shrink more than 3 %.  Hand wash or use wool program on the washing machine.  Linen: Iron when still wet."
A Tenor's Journey To The German Lands|successful|        .soundcloud .card {          max-height: 250px;        }        .soundcloud .embedly-card iframe.embedly-card {          height: 220px;        }        .card iframe[title~=SoundCloud] {          height: unset;        }      Greetings, my name is Colin Markey. I'm a 27 year old professional operatic tenor currently studying opera/art song repertoire at Temple University's Boyer College of Music and Dance.  I've been given the opportunity to study opera and art song abroad in Graz, Austria for six weeks with the American Institute for Musical Studies AIMS (http://aimsgraz.com) to further study operatic repertoire and the German language with a number of well respected artists in the business including Christa Ludwig, Barbara Bonney, Bo Skovhus, Patricia Craig, Alexander Kalajdžićand, and J. David Brock.  The AIMS Opera Studio program is designed to build the skills and discipline that will help you to succeed in the business of singing as a profession.  Courses include individual voice lessons and coaching on arias; a course in Conversational German; diction coaching in German, Italian, French, English, and Russian; master classes; an audition training seminar; stage artistry & movement classes; and individual coaching and Musical/dramatic preparation.  The Opera Studio program will focus on the standard operatic repertoire with emphasis on the works of Mozart and Strauss.  Operetta is also offered as an optional elective. AIMS is a six-week program with incredible one-on-one instruction from an absolutely fabulous faculty from professional opera houses and opera training programs throughout Europe and America. This kind of concentrated education enables participants to make dramatic progress in their skill and technique.  AIMS operates in Graz (the second largest city in Austria), and is only a few hours from every major metropolitan area including Venice, Vienna, Budapest, and Salzburg!    Scholarship has already been rewarded to me, and the tuition is paid in full; however, taking into account the cost of travel, meals, and any other expenses relating to the program (e.g. books, deposits, fees for accompanists and competitions, etc.) aren't apart of the tuition and are left to the individual to handle.  This opportunity that I've been given is a chance of a lifetime for me, and that's why I'm reaching out to you to make this a reality.  I thank you all for taking the time and for your support.  -Subscribe to my Youtube channel: Colin Markey, tenor and composer  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4xdLK7jWlWv-NSnnCB088A/feed. -Subscribe on my Soundcloud profile: Colin Markey  https://soundcloud.com/colin-markey. -Follow me on @ColinMarkey https://twitter.com/ColinMarkey. -Friend/like my Facebook page: Colin Markey, tenor and composer https://www.facebook.com/philatenor. Below, I'm posting my professional bio and headshot.  HeadshotMr. Colin Markey graduated from the prestigious New England Conservatory of music in 2010 where he studied Vocal Performance with Mr. William Cotten. Mr. Markey is affiliated with Delaware Valley Opera Company (Philadelphia) where he portrayed Don Ottavio (2011), covered the role Il Duca in Rigoletto (2012), and sung in multiple productions as a chorus member. Other opera chorus work includes two productions with Boheme Opera Company of New Jersey. More recently, he portrayed the roles Melito in Telemann's Der Geduldige Socrates (2012) and Puck in Purcell's The Fairy Queen (2013) with Amherst Early Music Festival of Amherst, MA. His current work includes being a core member with Princeton Pro Musica under the direction of Maestro Ryan James Brandau, and is the tenor section leader for Morristown United Methodist Church in Morrisville, PA under the direction of George Gray, Mr. Markey's voice instructor. In the spring of 2015, Mr. Markey performed the role Il Podestà with great success in Temple University Opera Threatre's production of Mozart's La finta giardiniera. Due to his unique vocal range, spot-on sense of pitch, powerful yet lyrical vocal qualities, and a well-developed technique, Mr. Markey's repertoire varies from early Baroque to such contemporary composers as Anton Webern and Benjamin Britten. He currently studies with George Gray, adjunct professor of voice at Temple University's Boyer College of Music and Dance.There is no set back.

I can then start selling my treats online and farmer's markets.  I wanna say that I will go nationwide but honestly I really want something that's just here in Louisville, Ky.  I really believe in the Farm to Table Program. Using all Kentucky made products not only helps local farmers but helps make sure that I know how they are made and that I use the safest and freshest products.  I'm not afraid to get dirty.Your donation will help fund the start up cost for the business, such as licenses, materials, commercial kitchen fees,packaging etc. So please, please take the time to look at my project.  Just know that by helping me, you will also be helping local farmers.  I love keeping it Local! Plus........I have a really really cute daughter.  I am a very proud mamaIn advance thank you everyone for taking the time to check this out! I will be giving updates as soon as I get the shirts together! or just to entice you with pictures of delicious sweets.  I might even invent smell-o-vision just to get you to donate. But most of all you don't want to disappoint my biggest fan.... :(Please don't make her cry! :(As far as challenges go, honestly its just the funding.  I really need to be licensed in order to sell and I unfortunately do not have the funds to do that.  I want to do this right and make sure that I am qualified to sell here in the state of Kentucky and also to sell online.  But one thing that you do not have to worry about is my passion and commitment,  THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO DO! (sorry didn't mean to yell at you. I'm just so passionate!) Everyday I think about cake designs and doodle ideas! I even dream about baking! I really love this and I think everyone who has tried my baking can tell you that every single cupcake, cookie and cakepop etc is made with love.  I make everything in small batches that way I know that everything taste the same every single time!  I honestly don't even have a stand up mixer..I have a hand mixer so when I say that it's made with love it really is. You saw a wedding spread in my slide show you say? Yes, I baked for my bestfriend's weddind, over a thousand treats entirely with a hand mixer.  I am determined, completely resourceful and very creative.  Give me a problem, a theme something I will make it happen.  Please give me a chance to show the world.
Wheeling, Careening, and Wandering through the EMP|successful|"Whistlestop Dance Company and Light Motion's presentation for the Pop Conference: Wheeling, Careening, and Wandering through the EMP approximately 1 pm on Saturday, April 26, 2014In this site-specific dance, the six dancers, three in wheelchairs and three ""stand-ups"" will use the EMP Museum as inspiration. Dancers will be revealed as the freight elevator opens. Using straight and curved pathways, moving in connection and independently, they will travel to the mirrored wall near the gallery entrance. There they will execute a combination of movements emerging from the ways wheelchair dancers and ""stand-ups"" have discovered to highlight their commonalities and their differences. Dancers will connect with each other and their reflections and synchronize the movement to the music.Then onto the Sky Church for a movement section where the dancers will careen through the space, spinning and tossing each other into long glides across the floor.Next, they will wander to Trimpin's sculpture, If VI Was IX, for pulling, passing and roaming around the tower. For this portion of the dance, the cell ringtones of the conference participants will be the musical accompaniment. Finally, they will travel to the freight elevator where the doors will close on their dance.With all live performances, there is the possibility of unexpected events. As this is a site specific performance, there will be the possibility of needing to change the dance as we go. We will have the choreographers on site for any adjustments that need to be made as well as museum staff and volunteers to ensure the performance goes smoothly."
Fireball Newsflash Crosswords 2015-16|failed|“All the News That Fits Symmetrically”This is a follow-up to my Kickstarter projects from July to December 2013 and from July 2014 to May 2015. They went so well I decided to do it again. Like last time, the puzzles will come once every two or three weeks, so it will last about a year.Try a Sample PuzzleHere is a sample puzzle from 2013. To try it, right-click on it and open it in a new tab, and then print it.(For the answer grid, click here.)The BackstoryFrom January 2009 to March 2013, I wrote a crossword for every issue of The Week magazine. Each puzzle was based on the events from the previous week, and I put as many news-related items into the grid as I could.My big problem with writing for The Week was that I wrote the puzzle on Fridays, but the solvers didn’t get the magazine delivered to them until seven days later. That made the newsworthiness of the crossword less than ideal. By using email, I can send the puzzle to solvers the second it’s finished. Back this project and you can be part of the forefront for how crosswords are delivered to solvers in the digital age.About the PuzzlesThese puzzles will be delivered to your email inbox in two forms: Across Lite, which can be solved on your computer, and pdf, which can be printed and solved on paper. They will generally come every other week, but there will be occasional exceptions. It will finish around May 2016.Note that unlike the superhard Fireball Crosswords, Fireball Newsflash Crosswords are aimed at a general audience. The difficulty level will be like that of a typical Tuesday or Wednesday newspaper crossword.The CapFireball Crosswords baseball capAbout MeI started Fireball Crosswords in 2010 as the first online-only pay-to-play direct-to-the-solver crossword. I have written or edited more than 50 puzzle books, with combined sales of over a million copies. I was the editor of the Post Puzzler, a tough themeless crossword that appeared in every Sunday Washington Post from April 2010 to March 2015. From 2002 to 2008, I was the crossword editor for the New York Sun. I am the editorial director for Puzzlewright Press, an imprint of Sterling Publishing, where I have worked for the last 18 years. I am also the creator of the iPhone app Celebrity: Get a Clue.Available BooksNew York Sun Crosswords #6New York Sun Crosswords #7New York Sun Crosswords #8New York Sun Crosswords #9New York Sun Crosswords #10New York Sun Crosswords #11New York Sun Crosswords #12New York Sun Crosswords #13New York Sun Crosswords #14New York Sun Crosswords #15New York Sun Crosswords #16New York Sun Crosswords #17New York Sun Crosswords #18New York Sun Crosswords #19New York Sun Crosswords #20New York Sun Crosswords #21New York Sun Crosswords #22New York Sun Crosswords #23 Sizzlingly Hard Fireball Crosswords Blazingly Hard Fireball CrosswordsInfernally Hard Fireball CrosswordsHellaciously Hard Fireball CrosswordsAs newspapers and magazines struggle to survive in the current economy, more and more are cutting back on extras like crossword puzzles. Professional puzzle writers are losing opportunities left and right. There has to be a better way than going through magazines and newspapers to get puzzles to the solvers. By supporting this campaign, you are providing direct support to the writer, allowing me to continue to write the news puzzles that I so enjoy doing.As for the deadlines, I wrote more than 200 crosswords for The Week without missing any. This is the third year I’m doing this through Kickstarter, and the first two years went very smoothly. Solvers will get the puzzles before the ink dries on the news.

Living Coaster - a beverage coaster that grows plants!|failed|Great ideas happen while relaxing with a cold drink in your hand. Sitting at a cafe in Saigon, Vietnam, Lyriel and Marshall realized a clever way to put to use that puddle of water that appears under your drink. Soon after, Lyriel created a simple 3D model with Tinkercad.com and two prototypes were 3D printed. A few tiny succulents and a cactus were planted and many hours of strenuous product testing followed (it’s hard work enjoying a cold drink! ;). After a few learnings and iterations, Lyriel hired a professional plastic tooling engineer to model Living Coaster and design the needed tooling for mass production.We need your support to purchase plastic mold tooling and to cover material costs for fulfilling the kickstarter orders. The 3D coaster design and plastic-injection tooling design is complete, a reliable manufacturer has been identified and shipping logistics have been confirmed. Basically, once the tooling has been created, we can go right into a pilot production for a sample check and then mass production. Amazon will be used for fulfillment/shipping. We are planning on mass production to begin in late July and Kickstarter orders to arrive at your home by mid September. For colors, there is a large MOQ (minimum order quantity) so we are starting with 1 color -  black. If we meet stretch goals for this kickstarter campaign, we’ll be able to offer more colors. Once the campaign ends, I’ll send out a final order form so you can choose your colors.Please note, Living Coasters do NOT come with plants, due to shipping constraints - you will need to purchase plants separately. Please see the links below for suggested online retails. Thanks for understanding!Visit: http://www.livingcoaster.comWHAT IT IS  Living Coaster protects your furniture from watermarks from your cold drink but instead of letting that water go to waste, it puts it to good use by growing plants (patent pending). Made from 50% recycled ABS plastic, it can also be 100% recycled if it becomes unusable. By just enjoying a cold beverage a couple times a week, you can grow a tiny succulent garden with no extra effort. HOW IT WORKS  - LIKE MAGIC!Condensation from your cold drink drips down into the Living Coaster where it is funneled to the succulents growing in the connected plant pot. MULTIPLE COASTERS - STACK ITLiving Coaster loves other Living Coasters and when united, they can stack together forming a spiraling tower of tiny garden goodness. Stacking coaster setTINY PLANTS - PERSONALIZE ITInside a dark cardboard box that’s sitting in a warehouse is no place for plants so we ship Living Coaster without any. We found a few online succulent shops that will mail you plants of your choosing that fit perfectly in Living Coaster.https://needlesandleaves.nethttps://thesucculentsource.comHOW TO USE IT Use Living Coaster as you would any other coaster. Depending on the species of plant you choose, using Living Coaster a couple times a week provides the plants with enough water to live. For most plants, you will want the soil to dry out before your next use - if the soil is always wet, the plants will start to rot. When not in use, It is best to store Living Coasters in a sunny place such as a window sill during the day. Follow the care instructions for your plants. Living Coasters with plants and cold drinksFOR BEST RESULTSResults depend greatly on your environment - specifically temperature and humidity. For example, a glass of ice-cold lemonade on a Living Coaster outside in Georgia during the summer will be swimming in condensation versus the same ice-cold drink outside at night in the high desert. In a climate controlled house, humidity and temperature are usually in range for good results. What’s cooler than cool? Ice cold. The colder the beverage (and container), the more condensation you’ll get. Also, the shape and type of beverage container plays an important role. Glass or metal seems to work the best, with a tumbler or pint style shape yielding the best results. Wine glasses or similar don’t work so well as the condensation rarely reaches the base of the glass. So naturally, a crushed-ice slurpy in a copper cup will make more condensation than a chilled beer in an insulated travel mug. The nice thing about Living Coaster is that it is interesting and cute to look at, so even if you’re into only drinking room temperature wine from a wine glass, you can still use Living Coaster - you’ll just have to hand water it from time to time, just like any other potted plant.

Naturalia - Young Adult Book! Surprise for my girlfriend|failed|"Hi, First let me introduce myself, so you get to know the person behind this kickstarter project.My name is Jorgen and i live together with my girlfriend for about 2 years now. After 2 years living together in our appartment ment we decided to build a house together to start our life long future.When we first met she said to me she had ( in her eyes ) a strange hobby, and she didn't want to tell me right now because she was ashamed of herself. After convincing her she told me ( after a few days ) she was writing a book, nothing big she said. I felt like she had not much confidence about it so i asked her if there was a chance that i could read it, actually i am not reader at all , i had never read a book in my life. But because she was so mysterious about it i really wanted to read it. She sended me the first chapter trough email. In the email she wrote this message : ""Don't find me weird because i am writing a book, its just a thing I do when i am bored"". I READ THE WHOLE FIRST CHAPTER IN ONE GO! After a couple of hours i sended her a text message I finished the first chapter. She said i was lying because she couldn't believe i read it so fast.I was amazed how good it was! for a guy like me that never read a book i suprised even myself that i read the chapter in one go. To make a long story short, after many times convincing her to read another chapter, i read the whole book ( allready +- 300 pages ) and i was even more amazed. Why did i started this kickstarter project? In the two years we are living together, she had 3 appointments with a publisher. But when it was time to leave the appartment she got panic attacks, she started doubting herself, her book and everything she was confidenced about an hour before. She thinks they are going to laugh at her, break the book down and reject her. She is afraid to get rejected so I want to give her the chance to do it all by herself. But with the house we are building it is for me a bit tricky to do it without her noticing it.I want to give her with this kickstarter the start she deserves and that she knows that not only me is supporting her, but you all that fund this project, to get her confidence to get it all on the right track !Thank you all! I would be ever gratefull if this is a succesIt is still a work in progress, so it could take a while to get the book printed and translated to English."

These crafty and charismatic traders know how and where to make a fortune. In business they use various tricks and ploys to achieve set goals. Their spaceships are heavily armored freighters, constructed in a modular way with the purpose of adding further hangars and holds. At their disposal they have unique shields absorbing energy charges, which result from the enemy attack or cosmic anomalies. This race does not attack other civilizations but simply buys them.Everyone has a price…    Quuylto – is a race of aquatic beings worshipping science and science experiments. These little and curious creatures love gadgets and all technological innovations. They live under the surface of an ice-bound planet. Trian galaxy is a one-of-a-kind chance to study new technologies and artifacts of this marvelous civilization. Using their cunning, technological inventions they will deceive their rivals. For this purpose they use camouflage and holographic images of their spaceships.Technology is a melody of a triumph…    Xemh – it is a race known for its brutality and intransigence which strikes terror among other civilizations. These insectoid beings attack and plunder planets bustling with life. As a result, they leave exploited, destroyed, and deserted environments in which they feel best. Any negotiations are a weakness, which their rapacious character does not allow. Their warships are heavily armed machines sowing fear in the Galaxy.Attack is the only solution…     K’Haarquar  – is a race living on a planet overgrown with dense, preternaturally huge jungle. These winged and agile creatures created their cities in the crowns of trees, which give shelter to billions of creatures. Their civilization is based on unique abilities to create biological constructions.

In combat they take advantage of their numbers and regenerative abilities of their biological ships.Anything that lives can kill you…    Sslyx – a race of ruthless bounty hunters and mercenaries, working for the one who pays the most. Establishing cooperation with them is bound to a great risk. This race lives on the planets seized with deception or “abandoned” by their native inhabitants. Thanks to their abilities, their organisms can adapt to the conditions existing on majority of planets. In fight, they use chemical weapons and all kinds of mass destruction weaponry. Their light-armored, maneuverable ships are equipped with long-range rocket systems and wide-range self-destruction systems. In a word, these ships are flying bombs. Their fleet is composed of single units, which destruction is associated with great risk.Sign the contract and pray for your life…    Arvori – the peaceful, long-living race.

Where the Trian race arrives soon Arvori follows coming after their gods to thank them for their gifts. They can survive in any environment, provided there is only a touch of energy in the atmosphere. Their ships are equipped with energy absorbing systems. Harnessing the energy from the environment gives them  the unlimited source of power. They use this technology in fight to harness the energy of their enemies and immobilize their units. Arvori do not execute their enemies, only use their chances to retreat. Meditation and prayers are everything you need…    Volkharnian – This race does not have any planets or a home world, instead they live in many worlds by impersonating the natives. They use their natural ability of metamorphosis which allows them to take form of any life form know in the universe. To reach their goals they use manipulation and conspiracy techniques that they have perfected over the years. As a collective, they live on enormous space stations, the location of which is a great secret. Their ships are small and very maneuverable, and made to look like wrecks or space junk, just to confuse their opponents. We are everywhere…     Maephos – A powerful humanoid race, thought to be destroyed in a cosmic anomaly.

There were some mistakes and delays but we managed to deliver everything as we promised. The experience we gained resulted in new ideas and a new viewpoint for the future projects. Through this project we hope to reach new quality of game publishing. We will do everything we can to ensure that the estimated delivery date set for March 2018 will not change and that it will be final. Of course, it is possible that some issues with production may arise but let’s hope everything will go smoothly. The development of new edition lasted 1.5 years and the project is about 95% ready. The game has had a lot of patches over time and the tests have been ongoing for a year now to make sure there are no hidden mistakes in the game mechanics. In the near future you can expect new board game projects."

We believe this device may be of interest to engineers and curious minds who want to know more about air quality and are interested in collecting data about their environment.By using Air.Air! at home, you may learn a lot about air quality sensing. There are a lot of things in our households which decrease the quality of air substances and particles we do not have affordable tools to measure.The dust particles are basically invisible. But Air.Air! can measure it.Air.Air! will help address the lack of tools and data on air quality.  You can compare the air at home with the air outdoors and in the surroundings. You can the device with you, wherever you go. It even works in your car.There are a lot of other ways you can use it.The reason why we built this device is because human perception usually fails to detect air pollution, making it difficult for us to evaluate the amount of awareness we are subjecting ourselves. However, when the device provides a specific reading, we get something we can rely upon and share with friends and family.By having our own air quality monitoring system, we can potentially optimize decisions to decrease exposure to poor air. You can discover, for instance, that your furnace or wood stove is leaking and affecting your air quality more than you realized. There is  a nifty website ""state of the air.org"" in which you can type in your ZIP code and find out how polluted the air is for a particular region. The only issue with this service is that its data is too general. They do not provide the public with exact levels of air pollution for a very specific location.Air.Air! has a compact optical dust sensor developed by Sharp Corporation. In the dust sensor, there is an IRED infrared-emitting diode and a photo transistor, which are diagonally arranged in the device to measure the reflected light off of the airborne dust particles. This kind of device is especially effective at detecting airborne particles like the kind that are to be found in cigarette smoke and automobile exhaust, as it can distinguish between very fine particles.We also designed a iPhone (Android later).App to display tips and specific number of detected data. Good UI makes it easier to use.App view of Air.Air!Those of us who remember the 9/11 attacks on the twin towers may recall that the EPA provided inaccurate information about the risks of the poor air quality. Many of the volunteers, not having the required equipment to test the air themselves, had no choice but to assume the information they were told was correct. Sadly many volunteers now suffer from permanent lung damage.After the Tohoku disaster in Japan, the government failed to provide data on radiation in the atmosphere. Many of the citizens knew they needed their own data, but measuring tools became hard to find. So, open source projects filled the gap (one of them being even sponsored by two successful Kickstarter campaigns), provided reliable and low cost Geiger Counters. With Air.Air! our goal is to provide simple tools to make it easier for regular smart phone to monitor air quality in their surroundings. When it comes to quality of life, it is important to have control over the tools to conduct our own measurements.Terrible haze in Beijing in 2012Last year, a terrible haze engulfed Beijing. There was widespread concern about the air quality. Weather reports only gave one value for the entire city, failing to provide detailed and updated information about the environmental conditions of the city. Our device was designed and prototyped right after this event. Within six months of research and development, Air.Air! was born. We have a working prototype and we are asking the public to contribute to us, so we can bring Air.Air! finally to the market, distributing a first batch of devices to the Kickstarter community.We want to release it under an open-source license. This will allow a higher level of involvement from users. There's no telling what the community may be able to do with the published information.Open source makes world better.To do so, we will share all the files after we successfully reach our goal on Kickstarter.Design filesAir.Air! and iPhone 4SFor one of our stretch goals we would like to build an online community where people can publish and store their data. But this is depend on the popularity of the project.Data center diagrammatic drawingTo build the online community will require additional expertise. This is why we need your support. Thank you!We are designers and hardware engineers with the goal of empowering individuals to collect, analyze, and share data about their environments. We have done as much work as possible to make Air.Air! as reliable and useful as possible.Building prototypes and doing a small production run, is very costly for independent engineers and designers like us. We have to build molds, buy several components and pay for the assembly. Therefore we ask for support in bringing this device to the hands of the general public. Please join us in our effort to deal with a worldwide environmental issue with a very simple and practical solution!We would like to express our gratitude to all those who gave us the possibility to implement this project.The people blow show their great interests in this project and they also give us a lot of help:Luis Felipe Rosado Murillo, Devon Sean McCullough, Junjie Xie, Jason Wang, Kang Liu, Karl Chen, Link Li, Sun Knight, Zheng Dong, Zhuqing Kong, Jianjun Wang, etc.Timeline10/10/13     Finish optimization of circuit board and mechanical structure.

Tableau Vivant of The Delirium Constructions - GLOBAL TOUR|failed|This video was created with the help of our friends at Patch ProductionBeginning in 2013, my team and I are launching a TWO-YEAR-LONG GLOBAL TOUR of my multi-disciplinary performance art project, Tableau Vivant of The Delirium Constructions (complete description below/full performance video HERE). Traveling with a select group of Tableau vocalists, string players, and models, the vast majority of participants will be cast locally, allowing for each performance to draw its identity from within the existing community.Musical elements will be drawn from each city, incorporating new musical repertoire into the performance, derived from site-specific cultural tradition and native folklore. Building community and connectivity through art, Tableau will act as a pilgrimage, leaving behind a trail of tradition in the form of folklore, exposing simple, universal human truths (life, death, and love).  Fusing societies, Tableau will transcend other methods of communication, acting as a vehicle for cultural exchange and expansion.Tableau Vivant of The Delirium Constructions is a 75-minute, 120-body performance event, derived from the processes and methods of my still photographic series, which explores disparate characters and themes brought together in the same space to study improbable, close interactions. The performance itself exists within the larger framework of a 4-5 hour audience-integrating nightlife experience. Performances begin in silence and stillness, as the audience confronts a static composition: a stack of human forms.  As the performance unfolds these forms come to life, singly and in groups, alternating between static pose and surging gesture. Music emerges, evolving into choral harmonies; visual relationships are born and torn asunder; tension rises, only to dissipate. Finally, the performance melts into the crowd, eliminating the boundaries between the observer and the observed.Unlike traditional theatre, the art of Tableau is rooted in the identities and interactions of the people involved—most of whom have little or no experience in performing arts of any kind. They are a “self-selecting” community, and the content is drawn from their personal histories and rapidly developing relationships with each other—in turn eliminating the artifice of “acting.”In sum, Tableau is performance, tip-toeing on the edge of immersive theatre. It is music, incorporating classical aria, local folk song, choral drones, and string instruments. It is dance, juxtaposing organic, arrhythmic gesture with choreographed movement. It is visual spectacle, as one-hundred-twenty people pose and move in a range of costume: historical dress, contemporary fashion, nakedness. Finally, it is experiment; together, creating moments of truly original, highly improbable intimacy.To see what we have tried to put into words above, visit The Delirium Constructions Vimeo page, with video footage available from select past performances (2009-2011).  For a Comprehensive Tour Deck, click HERE to download.(From left: Laura At Evelyn's, Pearl Ring, Wilson Pickering Freich)The Delirium Constructions was formally conceived in 2002 as a still photographic body of work, though themes from theseries had been present in Small’s photographs since her early teens. The Delirium Constructions, as live performance andfilm, did not exist until 2009 when Small set out to create an experimental immersive art experience as part of her annualmarketing event. Although her original aim was to promote curiosity about her photography, upon the event’s conclusion,Small became entranced by the enormous potential for creative expansion through further performative incarnations. Since 1994, Small’s photographic works have been showcased in hundreds of exhibitions, nationally and internationally.She has been granted nearly fifty awards, and has been published worldwide in print contexts, including literary journals,fashion magazines, album covers, newspapers, coffee table books, and fine art publications, including Vogue, Life, Rolling Stone, and The New York Times.(From left: Molly And EllyMay, Two Mollys On Blue, Laura And The White Stoic Peacock *All 3 available as part of the Delirium Constructions Construction incentive package!)																								Standing amongst the painting galleries at the Louvre,Small was struck by the diversity of emotions, gestures,expressions, and meanings shouting out from the confinesof the neatly framed canvases on every wall. Small imaginedwhat it might be like if the frames melted away and thesubjects stepped forward into the gallery to interminglewith each other – for the tragic to comfort his comicneighbor or for the grotesque to argue with the naïf nextdoor. Such unseemly and discordant pairings were alreadya driving interest behind her still photographic project, TheDelirium Constructions, yet the idea of invigorating the stillimage, so that the previously passive viewer is suddenlyimmersed within the narrative, was tantalizing to Small –and she set out to explore this idea further. Within all of her Tableaux, Small seeks to celebrate the humanform in all of its diversity. Her use of nude models referencesthe rich history and tradition of tableaux vivants, drawingfrom the works of master painters from the early Renaissancethrough the 19th century. Small presents her frozen models onpodiums of varying heights, against austere white backdrops,displaying the models as if they were classical statuary. Fullyand partially dressed models are juxtaposed with nudes in closeproximity, challenging the audience to consider the differencesand similarities between the naked and clothed humanforms. Through these visual combinations, Small exposes astraightforward look at human identity. The final presentation tothe audience—a skyline of human forms—achieves sculpturaland architectural weight, as the viewer scans among the staticmodels and groups, reading the ‘painting’ as one does a greatwork of art displayed on a museum wall.			Small’s Tableaux reach the young and the elderly, people ofall classes and backgrounds; non-artists and artists alike,the working class and the celebrity, the imperfect and thetrendy, the intellectual, the scientific, the philosophical,and the fashionista.			Throughout the course of the evening, audience membersgradually transition from passive onlookers to participantsin an interactive, party-like atmosphere. Upon enteringthe space, the Tableau Vivant exists as a static image,presented as a painting would be. During the 75-minuteperformance, the ambiance begins to shift as the piececomes to life, safely inviting the audience in, by way ofsound and sight. Small herself emerges from amid theaudience, directly confronting and handling performers asshe maneuvers around the stage.			As the Tableau concludes, performers and musicians enacta recessional exit from the stage, immersing themselvesinto the audience, allowing for both direct and indirectinteractions, promoting a dissolve of boundaries outsideof social custom and norms. Food and drink adds tothe communal, festive atmosphere of the event space,elevating the evening from spectacle to celebratoryhappening. It is the infusion of sight, sound, smell, taste,and touch—a demand on each of the basic senses—which pulls the “attendee” out of a passive regard, andmakes the audience one with the evening’s performers.			Patrons leave Small’s live events with lasting bonds—tiesto themselves, to one another, and to the community atlarge. In each city, Small’s Tableaux generate a dialogue ofsafe, close, cultural connections, leaving behind a legacyto grow with time. I am constantly in search of how to open myself more. Since [ Tableau ] I have lived knowingthat it is possible. ~Heather Van Uxem Lewis			I have never felt so safe with a group of strangers...

Words can’t really describe how much I felt and still feel. ~Alexandrea Thomsen I thinkone of the most powerful elements in [Sarah’s] work is that in a disconnecteddigital age you are creating a truly ‘live experience’. 100 plus people -strangers came out of their houses and tenderly sat together cheek to cheek,hundreds more witnessed it.

Seth's Pineapple Mango Salsa|failed|Seth's Pineapple Mango Salsa is an all-natural product that uses healing fruits made from fresh cut pineapples and mangoes that taste really good.The product promotes good health by supplying natural nutrients that aide the body in digestion while providing it with antioxidants. We strive to be a part of the community to strengthen relationships to improve our general health and well being.  The plan is to continue to market this product and go beyond the local Saturday Morning Markets to a broader audience by putting it on the shelf in the local markets that support small business.This is my plan: Selling prepackaged foods requires a food permit in order to be in compliance with the Florida Department of Business.  This permit can only be acquired by preparing the product in the kitchen of a facility that has meet their approval. In addition to the permitting fees, there are associated rental fees. The next step is to raise the money to meet the labeling requirements for Bay Tech Label to produce the labels.  This is where we need your support to manufacture it and then distribute it. Shipping costs is also a part of the project along with a website.  Kickstarter is a great source to support that process to secure some of the financing.  I also have a business mentors for guidance and resources at the Business Center and the local Bank. In the mean time, we are out in the community in health fairs providing a product to those that want to improve their general health and well being.   Unique challenges that I might face is the death of a key member in the business and computer problems. To overcome this challenge, we will cross train.      Cash flow is always an issue.  By careful planning and detailed itemization and a business plan with investors and endorsers to support our product. Having a business plan is the solution.  Being financially secure in the beginning.      Food production problems if members aren't present.  Cross trained member will help.     Having the proper tools to make Salsa and refrigeration it. I have a friend that use to be a Chef that has donated boxes of knives     I have researched sources to help me to overcome challenges.  There are well equipped Business Centers that offer assistance to small businesses.  They have volunteers that have been successful in their own business and offer professional expertise advise.      The bank, Well Fargo, has tutorials and a wealth of information covering all aspects of developing, marketing, financing, credit building and sustaining your business online.  I am a subscriber to online help and training.
One Day at a Time: 365 Days of Photographs|failed|Why a 365 Project on Film?I am in love with the tangible. That is part of the reason why I wanted to do this project on film. I like the process of unwrapping the film and loading it into the camera. The sound of the shutter and the film advancing are all things that you miss with digital photography. I love the anticipation of waiting for my film to be developed.  Then I cut and sleeve my negatives and hold up a loupe while up against a window because I don't have a light table.  These are all the aspects of the art of photography that I miss and that many people don't get to experience in this digital age.  A few other reasons for my choice in photographing an entire year on film is that the camera I am using was a present from my late parents.  Since they gave it to me, I certainly have not taken advantage of it.  This is my chance. Also, film is what I know and what I am most comfortable with. A fellow photographer that I used to work with took on this project a couple of years ago and he said it was one of the most difficult projects he's ever done. It may sound easy to take just one picture a day for 365 days, but it can be taxing.  However, this project has opened my eyes and made me appreciate the people, places and things that might normally get overlooked.  All of these things combined are the reasons why I took on this mission and why I must complete it.Why Kickstarter?I began the year photographing with ease and making each day happen. I have been successfully taking one picture a day and continue to power through this journey. But, as you know, life happens and I've hit a wall that I am sure many artists encounter. My own capital is running low. I am determined to finish this project, and I would be honored and immensely appreciative of your support in my endeavor.What will your donations go towards?With your generous support, I will be able to buy the film (approximately 65 rolls of 120 film) that I need to complete this project and finish the year strong. You will also aid me in getting all of this film developed (in the end, probably about 90 to 95 rolls), getting high resolution negatives scans (that's right, 365 individual negative scans) and finally getting this book edited, designed and published, which will all be done by yours truly. I am going to self-publish this book using a lovely company called Artifact Uprising (a fellow artist here on Kickstarter led me to them!).Thank YouA HUGE thank you in advance to all of my future backers.  To Eric Maltz for providing the beautiful music for my video.To my parents - who, even in spirit - I know are supporting me. They are giving me the will and determination to complete my journey.And last, but certainly not least, to my family and friends, who have always encouraged my work and shown their belief in my talent.REWARDS UPDATE!For all current and potential backers I've add the Recognition and Dedication reward at EVERY pledge level! Dedications will be all throughout the coffee table book now. Backers will be able to put their mark on the book with the addition of their dedication on their birth date. For those that back my project at the $10, $25, and $75 level, they also receive a digital copy of their birthdate page to share with friends, family and and the whole of the interwebs.At this point, I cannot update the rewards in regards to what the reward is so I've added it here to the main page and I'll be sure to request that information in my survey once funding has successfully ended(*crossing fingers!*).The biggest challenge is not letting life's daily demands get in the way of my shooting one picture a day, but I am committed to meeting challenges head on.  I know I can do it.One of my major concerns is that, once the film is developed, a day may not come out right and it is unusable. Since I cannot see my results immediately, I am utilizing my education, my experience and my tools (namely my light meter) to help me out.Other risks and challenges will be in editing all of this film, making the best selection for each day based on exposure, designing and laying out the book and, editing the copy to getting the book printed and published all while staying on schedule to fulfill the backer rewards by their projected delivery dates.

Planet Hell Productions is currently lacking the funds needed to cover the production costs, equipment, and supplies in order to complete this project. The only risks are acquiring the permits and permission to use the preferred locations. We are currently in the process of completing these challenges by obtaining any permits if needed and obtaining written permission from the land owners and counties. We have all the legal paperwork ready for the process for example; video release forms and accident/liability waivers for legal purposes and protection."
Little Falcon Needs Your Help!|failed|Hey guys, I'm Little Falcon! You may know me from Facebook, Tumblr, or you're just walking in because you like to look at stuff! As you may or may not know, I am recording an album! With the wonder that is Kickstarter, I can offer you guys predownloads of the album before it's released to anyone else, signed hardcopies, t-shirts, bracelets, and tons of other merch that won't be around much longer! Becoming a backer helps me raise money for recording costs, packing for the CDs, and a bunch of other things that musicians normally run into in this process. This is something that I am really passionate about and I really want to make this a reality. I hear feedback from the listeners and it really makes me hopeful for the future. I just need your help to get there!
Customizable 3D Printed Miniatures|failed|With Mounted Heroes you can imagine your own mounted miniature and make it real through 3D printingWith Mounted Heroes you will be able to create millions of different miniatures by combining 3D modeled elements in our miniature creator. After customizing it, we will order your figure and you will receive it 3D printed in a few days.TRY OUR ONLINE MINIATURE CREATOR FOR FREE!Fully customizable fantasy miniatures and its mounts.Two different 3D printing materials to choose.Miniatures with high level of detail.Online miniature creator where you can already customize the Orc, the Human and the Mounts.You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.PlayReplay with soundPlay with  sound00:0000:00Mounted Heroes works with a web application from which you can select the different families of miniatures that you want to customize. Items are displayed and can be combined through a 3D viewer made in WebGL that allows you to see the customization process in a fast and comfortable way.  Once your miniature is finished you can save it in your favorite list and create your own collection – which you can modify at any time and share it with other users – or you can order it and you will receive it 3D printed in a few days.In Mounted Heroes miniature creator you can choose race, facial expression, pose, mount, weapons, equipment and clothing. You can combine an armor with different helmets, shoulder pads, pants, boots and even select the shape of the base. You can also customize the mounts by selecting an armor. Mounted Heroes miniatures can be printed on foot or riding one of the mounts. For instance, you could customize the same human knight on foot and mounted so you can use both figures in your favorite wargame as a unique character.Mounted Heroes miniatures are 3D modeled with exchangeable high level of detail elements. They are perfect for wargaming and painting. At the moment, we have designed and modeled two races: humans and orcs, each of with comes with four poses and multiple components. We have also designed and modeled six mounts, three for each race, and they also include different armors. The first figure that our team developed for Mounted Heroes was the human knight. With the idea of creating to antagonist characters, humans an orcs, our team designed the human as an honorable knight covered by a powerful and elaborate ornate armor. The human knight is inspired by the gothic knights of XV and XVI centuries and the Spanish Infantry of the time but with a fantasy touch of our own. We chose a Horse, a Griffin and a Dragon for the human mounts and we designed an armor for each of them inspired by the horses armor of XVI and XVI centuries.We wanted the orc warrior to be a fierce, agressive and bloodthirsty creature. If the human knight represented honor and courage, the orc should be a ferocious fighter with a barbarian appearance. We chose to make for him rusty iron armors, filled with spikes, chains and skulls.For the orc warrior we designed two fantasy wargames traditional mounts, the Wyvern and the Boar, but we also wanted to create our own mount, so we designed the Lizarodon, based on a combination between a lizard and a viper. 3D printing is currently going through an exciting time. There are more and more 3D printers and materials to choose from and the quality of the printers is increasing everyday while the price per copy is reducing considerably.In Imagine 3D Miniatures we believe is time to make use of this technology. Our commitment is to bring the design of 3D models to a new level, offering originality and quality in the design, and allowing the consumer to interact and bring imagination into the final product configuration.With Mounted Heroes we intend to carry on this philosophy, designing high quality miniatures of great detail that will allow the customer to appreciate the work and dedication employed to perform them. We want that our  miniatures combine the creativity of the customer and the quality of Imagine 3D Miniatures.3D printing certainly has advantages over traditional miniatures. In addition to customization, it allows to rescale the miniatures, include articulated parts and create other that for its complexity would be impossible to perform with traditional injection molding plastic parts.Shapeways is Mounted Heroes 3D printing provider. This company is specialized in 3D printing and allows us to offer highly detailed miniatures in different materials. Once you have customized your Mounted Heroes miniature you are able to order printing it directly from the miniature creator and choose one of the two materials available. We offer 3D printing in two materials that have different prices and definition and which we have checked that our miniatures are correctly printed in.White or black Plastic, with a little  rough surface, it has a lower level of detail. Its main advantage is its price, more affordable. This plastic is not suitable for small details, so we don’t recommend it for miniatures on foot. However, we recommend it for mounts because it is cheaper than the other material.Transparent material with high level of detail, which favors miniature painting and greatly improves its finish. We recommend it for printing on foot miniatures, because this plastic retains even the most sensitive details. The Mounts, however, although they have a great finish, also result in a slightly higher price than the previous  material.Boar printed in Frosted Ultra Detail.Wyvern printed in Frosted Ultra Detail.Details come out when a base coat is appliedThis image has been taken from a video review that news site Talk Wargaming made about Mounted Heroes. In it you can see the full process of customization and the final 3D printed miniature.All materials are suitable for painting, but the most recommended  for painters is the Frosted Ultra Detail material, because of its great detail and smooth surface.Human printed in Frosted Ultra Detail, Dragon printed in Strong & Flexible Plastic.All the miniatures can be exchanged for miniatures of the unlocked races of the same or less value. With our main funding goal, Humans, Orcs and six mounts – Dragon, Griffin and Horse for the Human and Wyvern, Lizarodon and Boar for the Orc – will be available in our online store. Once we have reached it, the next races and mounts can be unlocked. Imagine 3D Miniatures is a studio of miniature design, 3D modeling and tabletop gaming development. Our goal is to bring 3D printing to the world of miniatures and gaming.We are a group of enthusiastic professionals, fans of the miniatures, miniature painting and tabletop games, dedicated to our passion.  We have been working on this project for over a year and we have tested the miniatures and the system to compose them. Now we have everything ready to model and print the miniatures for you.We also count with the 3D printing company Shapeways that is the best partner to assure you the required quality and service.Our team is composed by 3D modelers, illustrators, designers and computer programmers, working together to bring alive this complex and ambitious project.David Pérez is the CEO of Imagine 3D Miniatures.

She is responsible of all the audiovisual material of Mounted Heroes.We have been working very hard the last year to create a system that allows miniature customization, developing the web app, modeling our first miniatures and testing them with different 3D printing materials. Your support will allow us to improve the miniature creator and the web app, to set the online shop, and, what is most important, to model as many more races and mounts as possible before launching the project. Although it is not the purpose of this Kickstarter, your support will encourage us to keep working in an evolutionary tabletop game that will use the benefits of 3D printing and miniature customization. With your support, you will  help us release the following 28mm miniatures:Fourteen different races with four poses and five armor sets each.A new set for the Human: Wizard.A new set for the Orcs:Chaman.Gender for all races.  Thirty seven Mounts.Three Creatures.The more funding we receive, the more races we can release. Help us make this project a reality!!We have already completed two races, six mounts and multiple interchangeable components for each. Complete drawings of the new races and sketches of the new mounts are finished, the web application is in beta and our team operating at full capacity. But we know we have many challenges to deal with:Our design and 3d modeling team must find a balance between the details we want to show in our miniatures and the possibility of printing. We must choose the races, poses, figures and armor which better results will be obtained and acceptance for our customers. We must design miniatures that really take advantage of 3d printing technology as for example mobile parts.We must find the way to be in touch with our customers to transfer their likes and requirements  to our modeling and production process, we have to promote our products and website to reach as many people as possible and implementing sales models that are attractive to them.Our team of computer programmers has the challenge to make a visually attractive web application that allows customization of the miniatures in an easy and fun way, besides we must complete the integration with our supplier to improve both productivity and customer service.There are other challenges related with 3d printing technology. We must keep searching for new materials to print our miniatures, with more resistance, more detail and less cost. There are many challenges but we know that with effort and dedication we can overcoming them.
Short Defender ©|failed|"STORY====================================================Short Defender Is a small open world game that takes place in a daycare poorly ran by adults and faculty, a young toddler by the name of Zack Johnson is sent there for a day with his older step-sister as their mom and father have a day to themselves. The daycare has a mysterious rumor going around about a secret vault where the faculty hides confiscated items in, including a great item that can determine the towns very fate! This rumor seperates the daycares kids in factions which desimates it for weeks up until Zack arrives where this is the final day to look for the vault before the daycare is closed down for mysterious reasons, the toddlers go crazy and riot causing an all out faction war around the daycare which leads to zack creating a superhero type persona called ""Short Defender"" and basically trying to stop the war, save the faculty, and find out whats in the vault itself! But...does he have the will to do it?====================================================FEATURES====================================================The Gameplay is A beat em' up style/ Platformer similar to the Bully, Batman (Fighting), and assassins creeds (Climbing) series but scaled down greatly as you are playing as a 41/2 year old kid he fights like a small kinda good kickboxer and moves with little flexibility/skill but a more hasty type movement . The combat is much similar to bully but has some batman arkham components such as a multiplier and snapping from one enemy to another quickly. Zack has a rage meter that fills when he is taking down enemies and increasing his multiplier and once it fills he goes into rage mode which can knock out enemies in 3 punchs! There will be various stealth sections that zack can take or he can go in a more ""Brawler"" style and clear the room faster although has a greater risk of being knocked out but it increases his rage meter with the downside of less experience. He has an entire skill tree to work on aloung with his gadgets and such, enemies body types also works with how they do in combat the bigger they are the more damage they do but they are slower than average or skinnier enemies. We plan on adding more things to the game but this is just the top of the barrel of what you'll experience!==============================================FACTIONS==============================================Grim Kids- Toddlers who rely on brute strength and intimidation to get what they want (mainly bullies make up the crew) Ran By Patrick The Ginger Bully.Robotnics- Toddlers who are stuck in a sci-fi world bent on turning anything in technology or adding something scientific to many things. They mainly rely on tools more than fists but that doesn't mean all of them carry weapons! Ran By Anthony The Goofy Irish kid.Spooks- Very sneaky/secretive kids, known for their back stabbing and creepy masks. They've been in the dark for the turf war, no one knows their main base/whereabouts in the daycare. The leader is unknown.HERO================================================Zack Johnson is a short stocky African American 41/2 year old his story starts when he was with his grandfather at a local bank on his 4th birthday when it was robbed, he was taking hostage and when his grandfather tried to stop the robbers he was shot leaving him injured. Zack was stuck in the car when he quickly fought and kicked the robbers causing the care to crash into a light post flipping it over fatally injuring the robbers. He was then hospitalized and became anti-social for a few months before he started getting bullied soon he gave in and fought back! And after realizing and coming to term with the traumatic events in his short life he created a persona to basically stop bullies and prevent them from leading on a life of crime themselves, So he became the Short Defender! Zack's parents bought him a dog to get over the traumatic events on his birthday in edition to taking him to kickboxing class in the months followed of him getting bullied. After weeks of learning how to escape bullies Zack is very agile and fast able to move through a new environment with slight ease and he is very good at hiding. Zack also now has a high pain threshold from being in a car crashed and being beat up on some occasions, He is also pretty intelligent knowing how to read pretty good at his age. He also has immense strength that he discovered after he managed to take down multiple bullies at once with a little effort! But he does suffer from some issues as sometimes the traumatic events will come back to haunt him, He is also brash and irresponsible always caring about his goals and not the needs of others always doing things and not caring about the consequences at that moment until later. He is controlling and can let things get to his head easily and through the game when he starts being known to the daycare/kid community (This is his first time actually doing this dispite the fact he created the persona a month ago he was just waiting for the right time) he starts acting cocky and screwing up constantly. He is also very rude and has a smart mouth quick to fight or argue then to reason or understand! But in all his faults he still is a good hero with a big heart.Height: 3'7.5-3'8Weight: 41IbEye Color: HazelSkin Color: Peanut Butter BrownHair: Buzz CutSuit Consists of a Slight Red Half Bucket that only shows the lower part of his face along with a Tin Red Chest plate with sections for flexibility and a painted yellow smile in the center underneath some football compression gear.

She Had Love On Her Tongue & Death In Her Eye|failed|"The project!My name is Ben Collison. I am an artist who has studied traditional drawing and painting but that's not why I am here today. I am here to self publish the unusual style I have developed in cafes throughout San Francisco. The recipe for my style is that I use coffee and ink to make art. First I draw with ink then in a risky primitive way I dip my finger in coffee then I smear, smudge and splatter it until the image is complete. I have created over 200 images, 100 illustrations and 100 textures that are ready to be combined into a 100 page hard cover book. The illustrations are sensual and gritty, only the way coffee and ink can create. The imagery resembles classic sepia tone photography. The subjects of this body of work are strong females inspired by classic 70's rock stars. Each page is filled with passion and intensity that is rarely collected in print. I am here asking for your support to help me self-publish this unique book. I will provide worth while rewards for your contributions.

Pocket Parking Meter|failed|"I came up with the idea for this app one day when I was running late for my accounting class. I pull in to the parking space and only found four quarters and had no time to look for another coin or wait for the meter to process my debit card. So I only had one hour on the parking meter, when my class lasted 1hr and 10min. In class I was thinking I have two options; leave class early which I did not want to do since we usually have questions that have to be submitted at the end of each class or sprint to my car and risk the chance of already having a parking ticket. Then I thought, ""It would be so much easier if I had an app where I could deposit another quarter in the meter"". So that night I started looking at parking meter apps and discovered most of them are just countdown timers with a cool looking parking meter design. Pocket Parking Meter will be an app developed in partnership with parking meter companies that will allow users to view time left on their parking spot and alow mobile deposits from their smartphone with use of a debit/credit card. Thidis perfect for the situation where you are away from your car for longer than expected and are not in close enough distance to walk before your meter runs out. User will get an E-Barcode that they take a picture of which syncs all info to your Pocket Parking Meter app.App DevelopmentNegotiations with parking meter developers and credit/debit card companiesMaping outparking metersPrice"
Mechabrick - A Minifig/Mecha board game and models|successful|"Mechabrick - Gangs of Neon CityWelcome to the Mechabrick Kickstarter!Talk to us on our Facebook page at: https://www.facebook.com/mechabrickUPDATES:MACHINE-GUN STRETCH GOAL - UNLOCKED!:BIG GUN KIT STRETCH GOAL - UNLOCKED!:RED MECH STRETCH GOAL - UNLOCKED!:GAME-PLAY VIDEO:You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.PlayReplay with soundPlay with  sound00:0000:00US DOLLAR PRICING:EXTRAS NOW AVAILABLE:What is Mechabrick?Mechabrick is a range of precision moulded plastic kits to convert your minifigs into 1/144 scale fighting robots or 'mecha'. You can upgrade your mechs with weapons and accessories and then battle for supremacy in a fast-paced board game using buildings and scenery built from your favourite plastic toy building bricks.The Robots:The robot kits themselves use the torso and legs of any minifig at their core and assemble from over 20 precision-moulded plastic components to make a multi-jointed, fully poseable 3"" (75mm) high model. Every part of the robot kits and every external attachment point on the assembled mech is compatible with standard plastic building bricks and minifig accessories allowing infinite customisation.The robots come with a special two-part 'shield level indicator' gaming base which features a rotatable wheel to show the robot's remaining shield energy as it is depleted during the game.The Game:The first game in the Mechabrick product line is 'Gangs of Neon City'. Set in the back-streets of a futuristic far-eastern metropolis the game uses durable plastic gaming boards (supplied in the game box) printed with a brick-standard grid pattern (4-bricks square) upon which movement and shooting range of the robots is measured.It's up to you and your imagination to build, change and rebuild the buildings and scenery on your game board from plastic toy building bricks and create your perfect battle environment.The game sets two or more players in a head-to-head battle of turn-based play using 'action points' to choose whether each robot should move, shoot or both in each turn. Customisation and upgrades to your robots are key to a decisive win, but be careful not to weigh down your mech with too many upgrades and make them too slow to fight!The printed rulebook supplied with the boxed game is only 4 pages long and is designed to be fun and fast-paced for all the family. We will be publishing free add-ons and expanded rules for the game to keep even the most hardened gamers interested for many years to come.The boxed game includes four of the 'Wakazashi-Class' mech kits (two black and two white), four plastic game boards, a decal sheet to customize your mechs and your scenery, two D6 dice and a full rule/instruction booklet.Why Kickstarter?We are a small UK based toy design company and games/minifig accessories are a new direction for us... in fact, they are more of a pursuit of personal dreams made possible only by Kickstarter. Although we believe this to be an incredibly cool idea and are confident of its success, we need to raise the funds to cover the high up-front costs of making precision injection moulding tools to manufacture the robot kits. If successful, we aim to support the Mechabrick range with further new products, rule updates, instructions for building new buildings and scenery for your game board and an expanding backstory for many years to come.Kickstarter Exclusives:If you back our Kickstarter, you are special, and you can get something special in return. At certain pledge levels you will get one or more of the following exclusive, limited items:Stretch Goals:Yeah, there HAVE to be stretch goals! We are extremely excited about some of the cool stuff we have on offer if we are able to get over-funded.Here's what we plan to do (updated as we pass each goal):The other cool thing we are offering... at any pledge level of £60 or more we will automatically include one of EVERY stretch goal item that we get to produce with your reward. That's potentially up to £49 worth of free stuff!The pledge levels available and reward packages are:EARLY BIRD OFFERS:EXTRA!!! POST-FUNDING EARLY BIRD LEVEL! STANDARD PLEDGE LEVELS:Shipping:We have included a nominal amount for world-wide shipping from the UK for all overseas pledgers. This is just £5 for pledge levels involving models and £10 for pledge levels including the boxed game. Please be sure to add this to your pledge level amount if you are outside the UK.EXTRAS!...By popular demand we have now added the option to add extra items to your basic pledge level allowing you to customise your rewards bundle.Please choose the extra items you want from the list below, add the stated amount to your pledge level for each extra you want, then we'll ask you in the survey at the end of the project what items you want for the amount you have pledged.Dubreq are an established company with a number of mass-market products under our belts. That said, we have set ourselves the challenge of meeting or exceeding the quality and tolerances of minifigs themselves on all our Mechabrick products so attention to detail and a good relationship with our moulding company will be key. With that in mind we are working with a UK based moulder who is experienced in making small, high precision plastic parts who we believe can meet our needs.Physical packing and fulfillment of the Kickstarter rewards will be our next challenge. To help with this we have secured the help of a local fulfillment company who can work from our packing lists to dispatch all the rewards in a timely manner.To ensure we have enough time to get the products right and get the rewards shipped we have allowed ourselves at least 1 month more than we anticipate we will need to go through the manufacturing and shipping process."
Cat Cafe Mad: Coffee Shop Remodel & Expansion & Real Food|successful|"Cat Cafe Mad  http://www.catcafemad.com   Facebook: www.facebook.com/catcafemadCat Café Mad is a  cat café located on Monroe Street, near downtown Madison, Wisconsin. We have been open for a year and want to open a non-profit cattery and a cafe to support our cats.Kittens At Cat Cafe Mad during Kitten Day There are usually about 20 cats at all times, with six of them being permanent resident cats and the others are fosters who are adoptable. It is a unique place to go for a cup of coffee, and to hang out with cats as well as cat lovers. People come to play games, do homework, meet new people, come to fun events and, of course, to cuddle with cats. With our expansion, we will be building a wall to completely separate the new café and the cat area. This wall will have a full set of windows to see through to either side. City health codes require full separation between animals and food preparation, which is the reason we currently have self-serve drinks and no food. For the sake of simplicity we will call the side with the cats the cattery. The goal is for the new cafe to support the cattery. This supports both the fosters and our permanent resident cats. Cat Cafe Mad: Home to fosters All of our cats come from local shelters, and most of them are at the café temporarily, as a foster home. We work with Community Cat of Whitewater, WI, to bring in cats that will be comfortable in the café. These cats of all ages and personalities thrive in our community. They are all looking for permanent homes! With the expansion, we will have slight changes in the cattery. We are going to separate the café and cat area with a wall, but also separate them by turning the cattery into a nonprofit. This will mean that we can allow people to come in to volunteer, and spend more time with our cats. Once the cattery turns nonprofit we will also be able to accept donations from the community to help with the fosters care.As great as the café is, it's still a foreign concept to many. Most who visit are walking by and looking for a good cup of coffee and a place to hang out. However, many are disappointed when they find out that we have self-serve coffee and no food. We are looking to enhance the customer experience by providing quality drinks and freshly baked goods. In doing so, we can serve people who are not looking to go into the cattery, but are fine with grabbing a drink for the road, or just looking at the cats through our window wall.Making a purchase from the café area will also reduce admission to the cattery. This also helps our cats have an additional layer of protection since some of them are quite the escape artists!Cat Cafe Mad: Home to fosters We will build the wall with windows. We'll need to set up the cafe with a coffee grinder, espresso machines, commercial mixers, refrigerated bakery shelves, tables, chairs, etc. We will need to install working water as well to meet city health standards.Expansion Model So we've set target and stretch goals:$9,890 Bring water in the cafe (hot and cold). Build a wall with small windows. Serve baked goods & great, real coffee drinks$24,000 Larger windows & crepes. Serve crepes for breakfast, lunch and dessert. Vegan & build your own.  Buy new furniture (instead of reusing the cattery's scratched up tables), full kitchen appliances.  $30,000 , TV set for viewing the cattery in the cafe, an ice machine and a large bay window in the wall. Sealed tunnel for the cats to visit the front window.$50,000 Move closer to campus downtown$100,000 We'd love 2 more: New Jersey & FloridaGoal 1: $9,890 Wouldn't you like to sit by the window and watch the kitties as you enjoy your drink?  To do this, we'll build a wall with one window (to see the cattery while you eat). We'll  be able to serve hot freshly ground coffee, and cappuccino. We'll be able to put a refrigerator and the sinks to go with our new water source. We will get supplied fresh baked goods from a local bakery in Madison.We know our customers and our cats deserve a cleaner space and hot water to wash their hands. We have to use bottled water as our store doesn't have water. The money will be used to install piping and running water.  The water set up is mandatory by the health department to open a cafe.Chocolate Cappuccino at Cat Cafe MadStretch Goal 2: $24,000 Come in and smell the crepes as they grill. Sit and have your uniquely blended cafe drink or one of our fresh fruit smoothies with a great dessert crepe. Have a breakfast crepe on a Sunday morning and a dessert crepe to share. We will build out the kitchen with a full sized refrigerator & crepe grills. Watch the kitties as you eat from the large glass window. Take your drink and go play in the cattery. We will also build the wall with a large bay window with ledges so the cats can come say hello At this point we will open the coffee shop: espresso, cappuccino, frappes, kitty named drinks, pastries, crepes for breakfast, lunch and dessert. Our customers will enjoy hot/cold whipped drinks and genuine French crepes, vegan gluten free savory crepes and even a ""choose your own crepe"" menu item.Banana Split CrepesStretch Goal 3: $30,000 Enjoy crepes, a pastry from our display case, and a frozen drink while you watch cats from our large bay window and the cat tunnel.  We will open our non-profit, and install a TV monitor in the cafe side.

Also, you'll be able to enjoy watching the kitties inside the sealed plexiglass tunnel when they visit the front window.Breakfast & Lunch Crepes: Vegan Too Stretch Goal 4: $50,000 Move to State Street or closer to campus: Right in the center of town, we'll be walking distance from the University of Wisconsin and directly in the heart of the city. It will have all the previous goals incorporated. It will be a full service crêperie and coffee shop with a huge area for the cats to play and hang out with humans. We'll have parties, relaxation, and cuddling with your favorite cats! We've found a place, please don't let it get away!!!Stretch Goal 5: $100,000  We will open our next Cat Cafe in New Jersey or Florida. The new location will be a sister clone of Cat Cafe Mad. Let's expand the help we provide to the cats and local communities!

When we started, we could only afford to do self-service coffee and drink service because health restrictions do not allow for cats to be in an area where drinks are made. Now that we have become established, we are taking 1/3 of our space and converting it into a separate coffee shop - there will be a wall with windows dividing the space from the larger cat area. This allows us to provide everyone with full service drinks and  small baked goods or crepes. The food would have to stay in the shop area, but the drinks could be taken back into the cat room and enjoyed in the company of our friendly kitties. We will require lids on all drinks taken into the cattery. We are taking a risk investing in this change to our layout, but this is how other successful cat cafes around the US are operating. We want you, the customers, to get the full cat cafe experience. We also think separating the cat area will make the cats feel safer and prevent escapes out the front door. We don't want to lose a cat like when we lost one of our cats for awhile! One downside is there will no longer be cats in our front windows. Our solution to that will be to put a TV screen showing video of the back room in the front window."
Pollock l’acchiappa-panzane|successful|"[Scroll down for English Version]Chi siamo?Pagella Politica (www.pagellapolitica.it) è un progetto indipendente di fact-checking. Nato dall’idea di un gruppo di 10 giovani professionisti che, incidentalmente, sono anche amici. Ha l'obiettivo di monitorare le dichiarazioni dei principali politici italiani e valutarne la veridicità. Diamo un voto alle frasi che verifichiamo su una scala da “Vero” a “Panzana pazzesca”. Il nostro lavoro è stato ripreso, tra gli altri, da Le Iene, La Stampa, Il Corriere della Sera, Otto e Mezzo, The Economist, The Washington Post e il New York Times.Le nostre brevi biografie sono disponibili qui.La squadra di Pagella PoliticaNon abbiamo proprio nient’altro da fare? In realtà, sì! La maggior parte di noi ha un’altra occupazione e fa tutt’altro nella vita. Nonostante ciò, siamo uniti dalla volontà di vederci chiaro in quello che accade in politica, e dalla consapevolezza che nell’era di internet e degli open data la verità è, spesso, a solo qualche clic di distanza. Perché permettere ai nostri politici di diffondere dati sbagliati e distorcere così la nostra comprensione del mondo che ci circonda?Come useremmo i €10.000 che speriamo di raccogliere?Ricercheremo, disegneremo, produrremo e diffonderemo almeno 5 fact-checking animati, della durata di 90 secondi ciascuno, tra settembre e dicembre 2015. Sceglieremo le panzane più rilevanti e virali e - siccome la panzana è bipartisan - ci assicureremo di coprire ogni parte politica. Eventuali fondi aggiuntivi verranno usati per promuovere i video ed ottenere un impatto maggiore, assicurandoci di raggiungere i politici e ottenere una correzione. Perché vogliamo fare dei video? Perché pur avendo pubblicato più di 1.800 fact-checking sul sito ed attivato tante collaborazioni con importanti canali media (Virus su Rai 2, Mix 24 su Radio 24, Linkiesta, il Corriere della Sera, ecc) il modo più efficace di far circolare i nostri contenuti ci sembra essere quello di brevi video animati. Magari non hai voglia di leggere un fact-checking di 5.000 battute sul Fiscal Compact; ma se ti facciamo un video divertente con Pollock*, come farai a resistere? Inoltre un video è più difficile da ignorare per i politici a cui vogliamo richiedere una correzione!Pollock l'acchiappa-panzaneChe impatto speriamo di avere?Ogni video verrà inviato al politico oggetto del fact-checking e segnalato sui suoi social media. Chiederemo al politico di riferimento di correggersi pubblicamente. La nostra intenzione non è quella di colpevolizzare nessuno, ma di alzare il costo di spararla grossa in pubblico.Speriamo inoltre che la nostra breve web-series ispiri altri progetti a intraprendere la strada del fact-checking in video (in TV o online). Più siamo e meglio è!Perché dovreste fidarvi di noi?Perché abbiamo una metodologia aperta e trasparente. Perché forniamo i link ad ogni fonte che citiamo. Perché quando sbagliamo (ogni tanto capita a tutti) pubblichiamo errore e relativa correzione sulla pagina “Oops”, accessibile dalla home page del nostro sito. Perché abbiamo migliaia di lettori (e una comunità di 16 mila like su Facebook, più di 5 mila follower su Twitter) spesso attenti quanto noi e più di noi. la ricompensa da 100€: una tazza Panzana Pazzesca su misura*ringraziamo il lettore Graziano Zurlo per aver ""battezzato"" la nostra nuova mascotte ________________________________________________________About UsPagella Politica (www.pagellapolitica.it) is an independent fact-checking project created by a group of friends and young professionals.  Our goal is to monitor statements by the main Italian politicians and fact-check them. We then rate the statements on a scale from “True” to “Insane Whopper”. Our work has featured among others on Le Iene, La Stampa, Il Corriere della Sera, Otto e Mezzo, The Economist, The Washington Post and the New York Times.Our brief biographies are available here (in Italian). The Pagella Politica teamDon’t we have anything better to do?Actually, we do! Most of us are not full-time fact-checkers. Still, we are united in our mission to shed light on what happens in politics, and we are aware that in the era of internet and open data, truth is often only a couple of clicks away.  Why should we allow our politicians to spread false information and, in doing so, distort our understanding of what surrounds us?How are we going to use the €10.000 we hope to raise?We will use the funds to research, draw, produce and disseminate at least 5 animated 90-second fact-checking videos between September and December 2015. We will choose the most relevant and viral false statements and we’ll make sure to cover all of the main political parties, since insane whoppers are bipartisan! Any extra funds will be used to promote our videos to reach a wider audience and politicians, to make sure that they will correct their statement! Why do we want to produce animated videos? Despite having published over 1800 fact-checks on the website and having regular collaborations with several media outlets (Virus on Rai2, Mix24 on Radio 24, Linkiesta, il Corriere della Sera, etc.), we believe that the most effective way of spreading our content is through short animated videos. You may not have the time or energy to read a 5000 character fact-check on the Fiscal Compact. But a 90 seconds video with the adorable and clumsy Pollock? We bet you can’t resist.  Also, politicians will find it harder to ignore a short video when we’ll request a correction! Pollock the myth-busterWhat kind of impact are we expecting? Each video we produce will be sent to the politician who has been fact-checked, and we will also post it on their social media.  We will then ask the politician to correct him/herself publicly. Our goal is not to single out politicians, but to increase the cost of making bold but unfounded claims in public. We also hope that our short web-series will inspire other video-checking projects (both TV and online).  The more, the merrier! Why should you trust us? Because we have an open and transparent methodology.  Because we link every source we quote. Because when we’re wrong (occasionally it can happen to anyone) we publish our mistake and our correction in our “Oops” page, which you can access directly from our website’s homepage.  Because we have thousands of readers (and a community of 16 thousand likes on Facebook, as well as 5 thousand followers on Twitter) who are as alert- if not more alert- than us.the reward for €100 givers: a personalized Insane Whopper mugWhile every project has potential obstacles, we believe that our track record of nearly three years of fact-checking means we are ready to address this animated fact-checking campaign."
Unconditional Hope -  A Survivors Story.|successful|"THANK YOU!We have succesfully reached out goal and we can't thank you enough, you've all made us so happy this holiday season! But let's not slow down. We've carefully budgeted the feature length documentary at $72,000, so going beyond the Kickstarter goal will be a great thing. We will be able to tell the story with better integrity with every dollar that is donated, so please continue to tell your friends and family. Small donations add up quick and you'll see every dime in the quality on the screen. Love to all!Unconditional Hope is not just a documentary film about one ofthe most courageous and extraordinary women I know—my mother—it’s also amovement and campaign designed to inspire more than one million people to livewith hope, despite whatever challenges any of us may face.When my mother was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease in 1981, the reality of the situation was a hard fact she was forced to come to terms with. She could have given up, accepted the diagnosis, and gotten her affairs in order. She chose to adopt Hope Beyond the Conditions of her circumstance and continues to lead an epic life with ALS. The existence of Unconditional Hope creates the possibility for something better and inspires acommitment to a higher quality of life across the globe. It is a campaign to engage life with Unconditional Hope regardless of the magnitude of peril or fear we face. We want to light the world on fire with Unconditional Hope.And we couldn’t have a more inspiring example: Mariah Gladis, therapist,mother, wife, and one the longest living survivors of Lou Gehrig’s disease onthe planet.What would it mean to livewith Unconditional Hope while suffering from ALS, Cancer, or HIV?  In a destroyed economy? In a culture ofdepression, ADD, multiple wars and school shootings? In a time when resignationand cynicism seems more accepted than ever? What would be possible if Unconditional Hope spread across the globelike a wonderful epidemic? Let’s find out together. Can I tell you why I'm making this movie?My mother was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig’s disease 31 years ago and told she couldn't have children because the physical toll of labor and birth would hasten the progression of the disease. My older brother Luke was born a year later, and I was born a year after that. I owe my life to her defiance of that diagnosis and its consequent death sentence. She calls it sacred denial.Since that day, when she was given a 10% chance of surviving 2 years, she has gone on to win dozens of honors and awards, including the Living Legacy Award - joining previous recipients such as Eleanor Roosevelt, Maya Angelou, and Mother Theresa. She has used the urgency of that devastating diagnosis to develop a new method of psychotherapy that efficiently and dramatically facilitates the healing of emotional wounds. Mariah’s work has transformed the lives of thousands.I’m making this movie as a tribute to her, as a permanent record of a special craft of life-saving psychotherapy, and as an answer to the question of why strangers stop me on the street to tell me “Your mother saved my life.”The film also reflects my desire to improve the quality of life for those around me. A wise person once said to me: ""If you want to be happy, make everyone around you happy."" These days, there seems to be a never-ending battle between hope and cynicism, resignation and fighting back. By examining life through the lens of this form of Gestalt Psychology, I hope to reveal a methodology that allows people to see the world as they choose -- without the filter of the past and the anxiety of the future – so they can answer for themselves the very same question my mother asks in each of her first sessions: “What's important now?”The Wounded Healer is a story of extreme courage in the face of life and death, the inspiring journey of one woman's commitment to repairing emotional traumas and empowering people to reclaim their lives as their own.HOW MUCH WILL IT COST TO MAKE THIS MOVIE?The feature length documentary currently is budgeted at $72,000. Kickstarter is ""all or nothing,"" so we thought it wise to begin with a smaller number to get us moving. We're all nervous either way! We need everyone's help to spread the word.*Copies of the production budget are available upon request.CAN I DONATE TO THIS MOVIE OUTSIDE OF KICKSTARTER?Yes! Tax Exempt donations are accepted.WHAT'S THE PLAN?We will film a psychotherapy workshop, led by Mariah, with twelve participants, each of whom is dealing with a different emotional crisis. This workshop will be the backbone of the documentary, with segments dedicated to telling Mariah's story embedded in the bones of the workshop chapters.The issues are both personal and universal, ranging from childhood sexual abuse, to divorce, to the loss of a parent or child. These are ordinary people, not actors, not contestants, who bravely share their life stories in order to transform their lives. As they gain insight into a specific trauma that has had a negative impact on their lives they heal not only themselves but, by extension, their families, friends and loved ones. THE WORKSHOPThe workshop will be covered with three cameras, documenting each person’s experience in three parts: an introduction to the trauma, a method of dealing with the trauma, and a resolution. We will interview select participants before and after the workshop, and gather “in the moment interviews” during the work itself. It’s a dramatic format that is both cinematic and uplifting.For instance: a woman, locked in a closet by her father when she was young, developed a distrust of people as a survival mechanism. Now, later in life, she’s no longer locked in a closet, but continues to distrust people. Her efforts to cultivate a relationship with a man are hampered by that distrust. It is keeping her from having a family and children of her own, leaving her desperate and unfulfilled. The walls she created to protect herself from her trauma are now serving to imprison her. She needs to know: there is hope.MARIAH’S HISTORYAs a thirty-year survivor of Lou Gehrig’s Disease (ALS), Mariah knows the terror of terminal illness and the fortitude required to beat the odds. ALS is a progressively debilitating neuromuscular disease that leads to wasting of the muscles, paralysis and death. Rather than succumb, Mariah has used her personal struggle to deepen her understanding of the pain in others. Her love, courage, stamina and passion for her life, her family and her work are truly magical and continue to draw people to seek her counsel.The audience will have the opportunity to witness deep moments of the human struggle while identifying with the client’s capacity to change and be empowered in a psychotherapeutic workshop setting. Those watching will have a chance to renew their hope for making changes in their personal lives while witnessing the capacity of a diverse group of people to transcend differences and gather together for the purpose of recovery.The audience can enter into a relationship with Mariah that will engage their own courage, and begin to develop a commitment of living well despite life challenges or perceived personal failings. Audiences will be inspired by Mariah’s audacity in love and her stamina and passion for life. They will be inspired by the strength it takes for Mariah, as a handicapped person, to get out of bed each morning to pursue her daily routine, and function well while being attended to by a personal aide.WHO WE AREColeman Gladis - DirectorCOLEMAN GLADIS is a film and television director living in Los Angeles.

It presents challenges morning till night, and throughout the night. From the moment someone gets her up in the morning, dresses her, washes her face, feeds her, and on into the night. TIMELINEThe Wounded Healer documentary currently is in a pre-production and funding stage. We have been gathering footage for three years, covering both professional work and Mariah’s personal life. We have a large stock of archival footage, from the time of Mariah’s diagnosis with ALS to the present. Currently, we are sifting through this material in order to select the pieces that most effectively tell Mariah’s life story. In addition, there still is a lot of shooting that remains to be done. We are planning interviews with doctors, friends, patients, and relatives – all those who can offer insight into Mariah’s process, struggle, and narrative.The timeline for production from time of funding is as follows:Locations & Persons Acquisition/Reservation 90 DaysPre-Production 30 DaysPre-Workshop Interviews/Shooting 10 DaysWorkshop 03 DaysPost-Workshop Interviews/shooting 10 DaysPost-ProductionLogging/Setup 03 days Editing 60 DaysColoring 05 DaysSound Mixing/Music 10 DaysMastering 03 DaysDuplication 14 DaysReady For Distribution.TIMELINE FOR COMPLETION: 8 Months after fundingDISTRIBUTIONThe Wounded Healer demographic will be male and female, white/black, middle and upper class, educated, and 25 to 65 years of age. It also is directed to those affected by terminal illnesses and suffering from emotional distress. The narrative of the documentary has a universal appeal. Below is an excerpt from Shaun Rein’s article in Forbes magazine “How Oprah Does it:”“She truly understands and relates to her core target market. Oprah genuinely sympathizes with her audience's struggles and aspirations. She does not pretend to have led a fairy-tale celebrity's life; rather she has revealed that she was sexually abused when growing up and has been candid about her battles with her weight. She uses real, shared pain to get closer to her audience. As she conquers her demons, her audience feels they can conquer theirs.”The same is true of the relationship between Mariah and her patients, and will be true of Mariah and her viewers.The film will be sent to all the major film festivals: Sundance, Toronto, Tribeca, Canne, etc. It is our desire for this film to make a global impact, and we will screen it anywhere we find a projector.Various versions of the film will be edited and customized for release in theatres, television, DVD, foreign, and educational purposes. This will leave possibilities open for determining distribution avenues, which present themselves at the film festivals. The most effective distribution strategies will be defined at the time of the first cut."
Finishing The Amish Appeal|failed|The newspaper business has changed so much since The Amish Cook column began 20 years ago.  The economic model of the business has changed, which means the column's model must change also.  A selection of fiction is one piece of the puzzle.The Amish Appeal is a combination romance and legal novel, which I would also like to turn into a film.  The story centers on the experiences of Abe Schwartz, a 24-year-old Amish man who is still sorting through his beliefs and goals in life.  The Amish Appeal follows what happens when Abe encounters 27-year-old Paige Roberts, a vivacious, beautiful and brainy attorney from Chicago who stumbles upon his farm.The Amish Appeal follows Abe's journey as he finds himself caught between the deeply held beliefs of his faith and the more ambiguous rules of the rest of the world.  During this journey Abe is forced to choose between pacifism and practicality, between the strict rules of religion and the gray areas of compromise.  Adding to the complications are the desires of the heart as Abe finds himself increasingly attracted to Paige who lives in a very different world. Abe attempts to find a common ground between the two.The Amish Appeal is my first attempt at fiction. As the editor and creator of The Amish Cook column I am always seeking new platforms to share my knowledge about plain culture.  I thought a fiction book would be a fun way to do this.

EZ Master: Double Boiler Attachment for Stand Mixer|failed|"EZ-MASTER As featured on KATU-TV NEWSGreetings from Dragan Concepts! Thanks for visiting our Kickstarter page. Every day we can see big changes in technology. But no one thought to help cooks when it comes to cooking with a double boiler.  Double boiler, or “bain-marie” technique was introduced by an alchemist named Marie Prophetissima  in the 3rd Century A.D.  And today we use the very same double boiler on top of the stove.  Let's make this big change together--don't you think it's time? What is a EZ MASTER MIXING BOWL?Never seen before on the market. New technology keeping up with our fast times. A change that could make a big difference. Dramatically reduces the time spend cooking.

For the answer, you need to look at its history! Romanian territories were settled by the Romans, Turks, Hungarians, Austrians, Poles, Germans, and its modern citizens still represent these cultures. Where else in the world could you find such diversity? As a result, we use pepper, paprika (hot or sweet), coriander, horseradish, and leaves of savory, tarragon, lovage, dill, and parsley to season our foods.2013 CALENDARThis calendar is made especially for Kickstarter supporters.

Shakespeare!! To fund or not to fund, that is the Question?|successful|What better project is there than mixing Shakespeare and 20 teenagers on a stage in May?  Nothing, and nothing will come of nothing (to quote the bard himself). The only problem is the stage part.  Please help us fund our stage and insurance for 2015. Don't give nothing, give something! We have very few risks to overcome after this project is funded.  We have a venue for our show, we just don't have the funds.  Thanks so much.

Charlie vs Goliath|successful|It’s easy to be pessimistic about US politics these days. An estimated 11 billion dollars will be spent in the 2016 election cycle, as government positions and laws are bought and sold to the highest bidder. Ordinary people feel marginalized from a system in which corruption and bribery are essentially legal. I myself became more cynical than ever after spending a year working as a journalist based in Washington, DC. Then, I got a phone call from this guy... Charlie HardyWhen Crazy InspiresCharlie Hardy is one of the most remarkable people I’ve ever met. He’s a 77-year-old former Catholic priest who lived in a cardboard shack in a Venezuelan slum for eight years. In 2014, Charlie returned to his hometown of Cheyenne, Wyoming and was shocked to see homelessness, hunger and poverty. When his attempts to contact the state’s elected officials went unanswered, he decided to run for office himself. Flat broke and living off his $400-a-month social security check, Charlie declared his candidacy for the US Senate. His opponent was Sen. Mike Enzi, an 18-year incumbent with a $3 million war chest. When Charlie called me to let me know what he was doing, I told him he was crazy. But sometimes, crazy can inspire.Charlie Hardy volunteers Josh Warren and Brett LittletonPeople-PoweredCharlie managed to galvanize a ragged band of young volunteers into making waves in Wyoming's elections and challenging the country's political establishment. I too was infected by Charlie’s unbridled optimism and felt compelled to tell his incredible story by making a documentary film about him called Charlie vs Goliath. Like Charlie’s campaign, this documentary has been powered by people, not money. I was joined by two other filmmakers, Jihan Hafiz and Julia Muldavin, who generously volunteered their time, traveling to Wyoming to join me on the campaign trail. Together, we’ve shot more than 300 hours of footage since 2014. Meanwhile, I've been working for more than a year with a top-notch editor, Cameron Clendaniel, and we now have a complete rough cut. But the last stages of post-production are costly, and we need your help to finish the film. If we meet our goal, we should complete the documentary by the end of September, allowing for the possibility of releasing the film before the November 2016 elections.Charlie vs Goliath Post-Production BudgetThe Power of Hope in Cynical TimesThroughout the summer and fall of 2014, I followed Charlie and his ragtag volunteers around the state of Wyoming, spending many nights sleeping in a tent or in the campaign bus. I was determined to document Charlie’s story because I felt it would inspire many others, in this country and beyond, to consider how they can make a difference even when the odds seem exceedingly long. In these deeply cynical times, it is more important than ever to remain optimistic. And while Charlie vs Goliath is a story about the problems facing this country’s political system, at its core, the film is about the power of hope, persistence and faith in the face of overwhelming obstacles.Gonzalo and Antonio, two of Charlie's dedicated volunteersStill Running!Two years after his bid for the US Senate, Charlie is running for office again in 2016, this time for the US House of Representatives. Charlie has rallied an even larger group of volunteers and if he wins the Democratic primary on August 16, he will likely face off against Liz Cheney, Dick Cheney’s daughter, in the general election. This Kickstarter campaign will run parallel to Wyoming’s primary elections, and throughout the coming weeks we will keep you updated not only on the progress of our documentary, but on this exciting campaign run by Charlie and his passionate volunteers. Charlie Hardy is currently running for the US House seat in Wyoming. If he wins the primary, he will likely face Liz Cheney in the general election.Meet the TeamReed Lindsay (Director/DP) is an award-winning documentary filmmaker and journalist who has traveled around the world pursuing his passion to tell stories of people's struggles against injustice and abuse of power. He lived in a poor neighborhood of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, for more than four years and worked as a foreign correspondent in Cairo and Benghazi during the Arab Spring. He met Charlie 13 years ago in Latin America, and they have been close ever since. Reed also grew up in the Mountain West, in a small town in Idaho, but he had never been to Cheyenne until Charlie convinced him to check out his US Senate campaign in 2014. Reed planned on spending a few weeks in Wyoming, but was so inspired by Charlie and his young volunteers, he has dedicated the last two years to making this documentary.Reed Lindsay, director of Charlie vs GoliathJihan Hafiz (Assistant Director) is a filmmaker and journalist with nearly a decade of experience filming documentaries and in-depth reports on the world’s biggest news events, from the Arab Spring to Brazil’s World Cup. Jihan has excelled at nearly every role in the production process, working as an anchor, reporter, producer, camerawoman and editor. In 2012, she was co-winner of an Emmy as a sound recordist for the HBO documentary In Tahrir Square. She covered the Egyptian uprising from start to finish and immediately afterward crossed into Libya, co-directing the film Benghazi Rising, which was nominated for a Rory Peck Award as best documentary in 2011. She covered the economic crises in Spain and Greece, told the stories of Syrian refugees in Turkey, filed in-depth features from Venezuela and Honduras, and filmed a documentary in Rwanda.Julia Muldavin (Assistant DP) has chased stories around the world, from the streets of Brazil to the open plains of Wyoming, as a multimedia journalist and filmmaker. She lived in the heart of Santiago when the student uprisings erupted in 2011 and spent most of 2014 in Brazil prior to the World Cup. She worked on short and long-form video content around the #BlackLivesMatter movement in Oakland, California and followed the movement on their most recent trip to Brazil to bring attention to the escalating human rights crises in Rio de Janeiro's favelas. She has worked as a producer, videographer, video editor, and translator for breaking news, short documentaries, and feature length films. She most recently lived in Quito, Ecuador as a Video Producer and Editor for teleSUR English, covering world events with an emphasis on Latin America.Cameron Clendaniel (Editor) has a deep passion for building stories through film. For over a decade, Cameron's award-winning film editing work has aired on national broadcast outlets like PBS and the Sundance Channel, as well as on many European and international channels. His films have screened at some of the world's top festivals, including HotDocs, Sheffield, CPH:DOX, Montreal, and DOCNYC. Cameron is a graduate of Williams College, where he majored in Studio Art and Political Science — and it's where he first found his passion for film editing on a Media 100 system. Born in Boston, Cameron has worked as an editor in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Germany, and now lives in Brooklyn with his wife and two children.Mithun Pramanik (Assistant Editor) is a Kolkata-based filmmaker with more than a decade of experience covering regional news and making fiction and documentary films. Mithun played a key role as a producer in the film 'Fists of Fury' which won a Gracie award for Al Jazeera America in 2014. He has dedicated much of the last four years filming India's indigenous peoples, known as Adivasis. His 40-minute film ‘Vision Through Images’ about Adivasis painting was screened in 10 film festivals and won Best Jury Award in 2012 at the Affma Film Festival in Kerala. His coverage in India ranges from women’s rights, to politics and human rights issues. Nicolas Rossier (Consulting Producer) is an award-winning filmmaker. His work has appeared on more than 50 US and foreign television channels, including PBS, NHK, CNN International, Al Jazeera, Spiegel TV as well as Swiss, French and Swedish Public television. He has been featured in The New York Times, The Guardian and NPR, among others. His films have been screened at top film festivals and venues around the world including the Film Society of Lincoln Center, the International Documentary Film Festival (IDFA), Hot Docs, and many more.Kim Borba (Impact Producer) is a filmmaker with a background in international development and a passion for social issue documentary. Her directorial debut, Noise Runs, was awarded Best Director by the Social Impact Media Awards. At Big Mouth Films, she worked on features like 1971 (AFI Docs, IDFA, Tribeca, Sheffield) and E-Team (Sundance, True/False, Full Frame, Hot Docs). As Impact Producer for Pushing the Elephant (PBS’ Independent Lens), she used the award-winning documentary to engage partners like UN Women, Amnesty International, and lawmakers on Capitol Hill in direct action around gender-based violence in the DRC. She has lived and worked in Haiti, Thailand, Korea and Ecuador, collaborating with grassroots groups on social justice issues like access to education and participatory democracy.With production completed and post-production in the homestretch, the remaining risks are minimal. The biggest challenge ahead will be distributing and marketing the film so that it will have the greatest impact possible. If we reach our Kickstarter goal, we know we can make Charlie vs Goliath as compelling and powerful as it deserves to be.

"""The Coach"" The Life and Times of Shawn Tompkins"|failed|"Myself and Producer, Bobby Razak aim to begin the filming production of ""The Coach"" (tentative title). Chronicling the life and times of the great martial arts coach, Shawn Tompkins.Shawn Tompkins just recently passed, leaving the entire martial arts community grieving and devastated. This doesn't just include his friends and family, but many students, mentors and countless other lives he affected directly or indirectly. He's worked alongside many stars, including Sam Stout, Vitor Belfort, Wanderlei Silva and many many others.The aim of the film is to chronicle Shawn's life as a trainer, friend and family member throughout the areas that he frequented the most. This includes shooting in locations such as California, Toronto and Las Vegas.My own story related to Shawn:I first found out about Shawn when watching the IFL about 4yrs ago. I was intrigued by the team aspect, and being a big fan of Bas', paid attention to the Anacondas pretty well.Once Bas stepped down and gave the reins to Shawn, I began learning more about him. After all, he must be good if Bas is referring him. Right?It wasn't long after that where I became a fan of his.I kept seeing him in the corner of Horodecki, Stout, Belfort, Wand and so many others. The notion of this kickboxing Coach teaching MMA escaped me a bit, but the more I learned of him, the more supportive I became.Finally I had a chance to visit him in person on a trip to Vegas a couple yrs ago. I walked in the reception area of Xtreme Couture and through the window, could see him doing pad work with Stout. I was speechless; grinning like a school boy.Just from that scene alone, I knew I was in for something great. And, hearing him give advice to his student, then interacting with the others in the gym, only cemented this expectation.Unfortunately I was only able to talk with him briefly about private lessons (which I couldn't afford at the moment). But, knew immediately that I'd run into him again.A few years later during the UFC Boston Fan Expo, I ran into Shawn again heading through the lobby. Low and behold, he actually remembered me and greeted me as if we were old friends. Again, our meeting was brief, but his warm personality remained.While Shawn only touched my life for a short span of time, it impacted me greatly in my own work without my realizing it. Which explains why this project is so important to me.NOTE: 100% of all the film's proceeds will go to Shawn Tompkins' family.PRODUCER/ CO-DIRECTOR: BOBBY RAZAKMy name is Bobby Razak and I had the pleasure of meeting Shawnaround 3 years ago when i was filming the Ruffo Brothers commercial campaignfor Tapout. Since that time, I’ve filmed him in several other campaigns,including Tapout Gym and Hayabusa for his signature equipment line. He was agreat guy that could make anyone feel comfortable; a beautiful soul. Our relationship did have its ups and downs, as I like topush someone to another level and Shawn is very opinionated about his craft. Ithink this combination made us bring the best out of each other, but also madeus butt heads a few times. And, like all friendships, it made us respect eachother even more. The road traveled in real friendship is filled with truth,not just surface communication. When Coach passed, my heart was filled with sorrow.But then I felt Coach tell me not to be sad, instead to honor him in the onlyway that I could. To make a film about his life and who he was.   So here is my letter to you to help me make this film onour Coach. Kahl is an amazing up and coming filmmaker who has a deeplove for martial arts and MMA. I believe in this man and his talent and hecalled me after coach died, saying he wanted to make a film about his life. Sohere i am; it’s my duty to Coach to make this. Coach once called me “the master” on his FB page… so thiswill be my final dedication to him. Please help us make this film."

We have three filming days scheduled for outside, therefore keeping everything crossed for good weather. If the British weather turns against us the film must still go on! We will build rain proof rigs and battle on.

April Alayne Studio.|successful|"Hey guys! My name is April, I'm a self taught artist in Maryland. Art and creating have always been a passion of mine and through a lot of hard work I've been able to make it my full time job.Sucker For the past 3 years I've focused all my energy on illustrating and creating art based goods, in order to share that passion with everyone.

We can bounce ideas around, collaborate, learn, and motivate each other. Or to simply have company while we create. In return,  creators can promote and sell their work through my shop.

ULTRA WAY COOL TEACHING PUPPETS|successful|I'm Lee Zimmerman The Puppet Guy: www.thepuppetguy.com I work at a lot of circus camps, teaching kids-at-risk all over North America using marionettes of my own creation. I need to replace the puppets I've been using for the past 18 years. I want to create 10 new ULTRA COOL TEACHING PUPPETS by the beginning of March and they have to be AWESOME. I've collected and constructed dozens of teaching puppets over the years - mismatched hand puppets, usually donated by the parents of students, and marionettes of my own design, radically different from most puppets that are out there which I find to be quite lame. But, as amazing as they are, most of my teaching marionettes have seen better days - they've been on the front lines for years! I want to replace them and I want them to match, to have a unifying look and theme. If there's one thing I've learned is that if you want to reach a kid today, you're competing with computer games - you have to earn their full attention. The only way to do that? ULTRA COOLNESS.My goal is to take this program to as many kids as possible. And, now that I'm working with so many specialized learning centers, I want puppets that are more tactile, stuff that any kid can use, no matter what skill level or ability.Which is where YOU come in! The puppets themselves cost almost nothing, becauseI make them all out of 100 percent recycled materials, baby! But they take a reeeally long time to make - you're paying for me to have the time it takes to create them. And, I want this next series of puppets to be my best work to date, the pinnacle of what is possible in the ways of the ULTRA COOL TEACHING PUPPETS. And, with enough funding, I hope one day to bring this program to every corner of the U.S.... and continue to blow the minds of the kids I teach in Canada with some seriousLee ULTRA WAY COOL PUPPET AWESOMENESS.My number one challenge is a little thing I like to call, TIME. That's it! I just need to pay for studio time...the more money I raise, the more I can create. If I get four thousand, I'll make twenty puppets. I have a lot of circus camps already lined up for next year, both in Canada and the Philadelphia area, but those aren't for three months. I'd like to make the most of this time, to render ideas that have been wasping around in my head for the past three decades. Plus, I'm at my all-time creative zenith. The stars are aligned - this is the time!
Chain Mail Creations|failed|"My StoryRecently, I learned how to do chain mail, and am relishing any opportunity to design some beautiful things with it.  I love the texture of the rings as they connect, and the beauty of the things I can create with it.  I also enjoy teaching others how to work with the chains.   It is not an inexpensive craft as the cost of pre-made rings can add up.  And with 5 boys at our house, money doesn’t go nearly far enough sometimes.  So, when a friend told me about KickStarter, I decided to see if I could earn enough money to purchase a Ringinator with which to cut my own rings.  It will save me money, as well as give me the flexibility to generate whatever sizes I need for the projects I am making.  I found a great local place where I can purchase 18 gauge stainless steel wire to make my own rings.  It is a Stainless Steel 302 that contains no toxic zinc alloy, such as that found on electric fencing wire, so this is safe for use in creations that will touch the skin.  This will not only reduce the costs of the projects I make, but enable me to continue to teach others how to do chain mail at a reduced supply cost.If you are interested in purchasing any of my products, here is a list of those I create so far, many of which are customizable with different colors or charms.  I look forward to hearing from you.Key Chain / CharmThis is design comes either on a key ring or on a hook for hanging on things like zipper pulls, lanyards, loops on bags, etc.  They are two tone, silver and the color of your choosing.  You can select the color from: chocolate brown, red, light blue, white, pale yellow, black, pink, deep blue, green, gold or purple.Key Chain / CharmPen Pouch ClipThis is a great way to carry an easily accessible writinginstrument, especially for professionals who need their hands free for thetasks of the day – waitresses/waiters, nurses, doctors, etc.  Even students in elementary, middle, or highschool, and college students would love this delightful present.  It would make a great gift for friends and/orfamily for the upcoming holidays, or even a nice gift for you.   Most pens, pencils, and highlighters willfit.Dimensions:4 ½ inches long with a 3/4 inch openingPen Pouch 2Pen Pouch 3Pen Pouch 1Tiny PouchesThese tiny pouches are great for carrying a small item likepiece of candy or gum, favorite die, up to 9 quarters, etc.  Kids heading for school will have a secureplace to tuck their money into as it can be worn inside the clothing.  And kids heading for the video arcade willalso enjoy having a place to put their quarters.  Charms can be tailored on a limited basis forupcoming holidays, if desired.Dimensions:1 1/2 inches deep with just over 1 inch openingBlue (Shown empty and carrying a 20-sided die)Tiny Pouch - Blue 1Tiny Pouch - Blue 2Black Iridescent Spider (Shown empty and carrying a20-sided die and a close up)Tiny Pouch - Spider 1Tiny Pouch - Spider 2Tiny Pouch - Spider 3Purple Fairy (Shown empty and carrying a Fireball)Tiny Pouch - Fairy 1Tiny Pouch - Fairy 2Light Blue (Shown empty and carrying a pair of 6-sideddice)Tiny Pouch - Light Blue 1Tiny Pouch - Light Blue 2Purple (Shown empty and carrying a 20-sided die and acloseup)Tiny Pouch - Purple 1Tiny Pouch - Purple 2Tiny Pouch - Purple 3Green (Shown empty and carrying a 20-sided die)Tiny Pouch - Green 1Tiny Pouch - Green 2Small PouchIn medieval times, chain mail was created as a way to keep awarrior safe in battle.  Modern chainmailhas the advantages of being lightweight and versatile, as well asbeautiful.    This two-tone pouch with gold ring that can beused as a handle, is a lovely example. When open, the bag can be filled or the items inside can be accessed.  As the bag hangs, the rings bunch up andclose the bag to keep stuff in.  This isgreat for holding a few dollars for a night out on the town as it is secure,like the mini pouches.  (Shown holding 10dice and empty.)Dimensions:2 3/4 inches wide by 3 inches deepSmall Pouch 1Small Pouch 2Small Pouch 3Medium PouchThe medium Pouch is a lovely bag for going out on thetown.  It is large enough to put an IDcard, a credit card, a few dollars, and even a car or house key.  It’s also great for holding small items forkids and gamers such as dice, cars, bey blades, etc.  Can hold approximately 35 dice (5 fullstandard set of 7).Dimensions:3 1/2 inches wide by 3 1/2 inches deepMedium Pouch 1Some of the random Cord Decorations:Medium Pouch 2Medium Pouch 3Medium Pouch 4Large PouchThe Large Pouch is another great bag.  It has a larger capacity than the others, forthose of you who like to carry more than a few small things.  Ladies, imagine being able to carry yourwallet and phone in such as stylish bag. And for you gamers out there, this bag can hold over a pound of dice(over 100 dice).Dimensions:5 1/2 inches wide by 7 inches deepLarge Pouch 1Large Pouch 2Charm Options for Large and Medium PouchesCharm OptionsMessenger BagOur Messenger Bag is a stunner!  It is fantastic for carrying small tablets ornotebooks among many other items.  It isshown below carrying an iPad Mini encased in an Otter Box.  Enquire about possible pattern requestsand/or the extra pocket.Dimensions:5 1/2 inches wide by 9 1/2 inches tallStrap length:       41 inches (can be modified to desired length if specified)Messenger Bag 1Messenger Bag 2Magnetic clasp to keep it closed.Messsenger Bag 3Shown holding an iPad mini in an Otterbox case.Messenger Bag 4Example of a messenger bag being used to carry a Kindle andstudent planner in large pocket, and a Phone and mp3 player in small pocket.(Extra pocket was requested.  This onehas a blue and black zigzag row pattern.  Additional Cost is $10 and the choice is zigzag or solid color of your choice.)Messenger Bag 5Messenger Bag 6Wooden Helping HandDo you love to create your own, one of a kind jewelry?  The Wooden Helping Hand is just the answerfor you.  The Helping Hand will give youthat “third hand” every crafter needs. Use it to hold projects when working on them or for keeping long windingprojects contained, as well as easy to move and store.  Great for chain mail, beading, braiding andother projects when you need an extra hand to hold.

I have tried to minimize this in a few ways.  1. I have started creating multiples of a basic square piece that I can incorporate into any of the pouches by combining them and adding extra rows or columns as needed.  2. I have already prepped a large number of jump rings by having jars full of ""closed"" rings and ""open"" rings that are ready to start creating with speeding up the process.  3.  I have begun creating some of the pouches in the various sizes to be ready to distribute."

An Above Average Grilled Cheese|failed|I'm a recent college grad with a dream to make an above average grilled cheese sandwich.While the decision of which ingredients to use was onerous, I feel that I (and my friends) have finally come to a consensus on which (of the finest ingredients available) will go into this masterpiece.Foreign cheese is a must. As is bacon. And pesto. The full recipe, along with pictures and perhaps even a song, will be available to all who assist us in realizing our lofty goal.If we have money left over, it will go towards craft beer and a basket of fries, so that the experience can continue long after the sandwich itself has been consumed. A little inspiration: http://www.buzzfeed.com/jessicamisener/31-grilled-cheeses-that-are-better-than-a-boyfriendChallenges we might face after the project has been realized include: returning hunger and a sense of longing (for another sandwich).
Supplicant - The Age of Dissidence|failed|"Hello. Let me introduce myself. My name is Roy Laurence Daman. I am an author. Like most authors, writing a novel has been the most singular driving desire in my life. To be able to take the movie screen in my mind and put it on paper for all to enjoy has excited me since childhood. I am extremely close to realizing the completion of this novel.Unfortunately the axiom ""Do not judge a book by it's cover"" is heeded very little. A novel can be the most epic, thrilling, and life changing story ever written, but without an enticing cover most people will not even crack it open to sample what is inside. The cover art must draw a reader in. It is the gateway where we begin our journey into the world of the story. It must give a clear understanding of what lays on the other side. It should relay to the reader the basic concepts of the story condensed down into the form of a picture. This gate must represent the feel and emotion of the novel or else the reader will become disinterested. They will put the book back on the shelf and look elsewhere for adventure.The next item of importance, after the cover art, is the description. The reader focuses more on what is inside. After that, it is up to me and a skilled editor to grasp the heart and mind of the reader, and to convince them that the novel is both worth their time and money. Self publishing has been an ever growing market that has given better access to authors and readers alike. Gone are the days of gigantic publishing houses bypassing extraordinary prose and literature based on the expected sales of the novel to a mass market. Now the audience can have access to niche genres that have a large following, but not one enormous enough to get the sales a publish house expects. The downside to this is that the author is tasked with finding and obtaining services that are usually secured by a publishing company. These services are: artist, editor, and marketing. That is where this kick starter comes in. I can create the content but in order to give it the best chance possible I will need your help. A talented cover artist can range from $500 to $2,000 depending on their education, experience and credentials. Editors can be within a similar range. My readers deserve excellent standards and I wish to meet their expectations. This campaign is an attempt to give them a novel that is satisfying from the moment they pick it up from the shelf to the time they put it down after many hours of exhilarated reading.  Now that I have described the project itself let me elaborate on the story as I am sure that is equally as important for your consideration in funding the project.Summary In the year 2179 dissidence is considered a disease. Everyone is monitored and controlled by a cybernetic spinal implant. The Rule of Law is immutable and unyielding. Those who disobey have contracted the Dissident Virus which spreads quickly and violently. It must be stopped at all costs for the continuance of the human species. The UCA tests for dissident behavior through a series of tests at the ages of eight, sixteen, and twenty-four. A high grade designates a student as a supplicant and rewards them with the most sought after professions within the government. A low score rewards a student with the being placed on the front lines as a soldier. Failure means remediation, until after the Third Test, then it means death. For the unlucky ones, they are taken to internment camps where they are experimented on for a cure.Humans are controlled by cyberstem A.I. that reward obedience with pleasure and can cause pain or kill for disobedience. Every word is monitored, every action calculated, every calorie counted. In a world of dwindling resources being unhealthy is a crime. After Aurora refuses to complete her Third Test scenario she is given a job watching over other prospective supplicant children. When her sister Nova helps those children escape to a group of dissidents, Aurora's concepts of the world are forced to change forever. Aurora's love for her sister throws her into an entirely different world inside the burrows of the abolitionist group named the FAE. An accident causes her to be the prime target of the UCA who is aware that she now has their entire encrypted server on her cyber stem. She must struggle against what she used to be, what she is, and the fate of all free people. Man and machine, alike.I work full time in the healthcare industry. I am also a full time father, and husband. Unlike some popular authors -ahem Neil Gaiman, Stephen King, Ryan Winfield, Glen Tate- I do not have access to a remote cabin in a majestic forest amongst powdered snow and free roaming deer. Having such a place to focus and condense my thoughts into the golden elixir worthy of my audience would be an experience to rival almost anything else. Not to mention my production time would decrease exponentially.I am not unlike many authors in this respect. After they become successful then they have more time and resources to create their following novels. This is largely why first books in a series are shorter. It takes an gigantic amount of time to produce content for a novel. That being said, there are possibilities for setbacks, and delays. While I do not foresee any at this time there is a chance that they will occur for one reason or another, and I would beg your patience if they do. This is sole project I am working on at this time. There could be delays in cover art, editing, marketing, or publishing. These would be factors largely out of my control, and if I suspect a delay that would be tedious for my audience then I would seek others who would be able to fulfill their responsibilities in an more expedient fashion.I also want to create incentives for backers to contribute to the project. I hope to have special edition covers, and additional content accessible for kickstarter backers. This of course adds time to production. I want the best for my readers, and that starts here."

Alé Garza's H.A.R.D.CORE!!!|failed|H.A.R.D.CORECreated by:  Ale’ Garza and Allen WarnerFrom the creators of DC Comics’ “Ninja Boy” comes “Dangerous,” an action-packed superhero concept with a nod to the 90’s.Afraid of the growing and uncontrollable super-powered segment of the populace, the government releases an airborne toxin designed to attack the super-powered genome.  But instead of instant death, the toxin unexpectedly causes violent insanity followed by spontaneous combustion.  With the world thrown into immediate chaos, its scientists go to work on an antidote, but desperate heroes and villains soon discover that the toxin’s effects can be temporarily halted by feeding on the flesh of their infected brethren.The initial graphic novel follows a group of heroes struggling to protect the world’s greatest super-scientist, collecting crazed heroes and villains for further research, and attempting to eliminate the destructive and murderous factions that rise up from both the human and superhuman population.  The story features over-the-top action and constantly changing locales, as our heroes face off with new and familiar foes doing decidedly unfamiliar and frequently shocking things.  Everything comes to a head as the heroes are forced to turn on one another, and the survivors must move on in hopes of protecting themselves and any hope for their world.
Kind Minds & Wise Souls... Launch Our Next Collection!!!|failed|"Peace! Thank You from the Entire TQ Team...Team TQ having fun together!Temple Qinesis is a brand aiming to encourage people around the world to become more active, creative, compassionate, mindful and heart-driven.Our KickStarter Project aims to launch the new Collection in the Temple Qinesis clothing line.  When you view our video, you'll gain a greater grasp of our purpose, and understand our ambition to create a successful Collection of Clothing/Apparel products.Some of the First TQ Collection on DisplayWe currently operate a Fitness Center, Community Center & Gym, that is home to classes and courses in subjects like Yoga, Meditation, Boxing, Kung Fu, Strength & Conditioning, Philosophy, Pranayama, Olympic Lifting, Kettlebells, Stability & Balance, Pilates and more.  We offer Personal Coaching/Training, Massage and Acupuncture, Nutrition & Wellness Consulting, Mindfulness Training, Small & Large Group Training and Team Building, Community Empowerment Workshops, and much more.Main Entrance of TQWe also hope to encourage a social revolution toward ""Kindness being the new Cool"", and replacing the mindset of ""Competition"" with the more enlightened concept of ""Compassion""..  An Altruistic Community of active & creative beings is who we are, and what we wish to inspire others to become!  We hope that you join us on this journey.  We already have X-Games Athletes & Professional Entertainers representing the Brand, and more to come soon, hopefully you too!Jamaican Professional BMX-er  ""A-Wire"" from the Crash Test DummiesGarrett Gardner playing live at Temple QinesisWe hope that you'll appreciate our purpose, and support us with this Fundraiser.

The first challenge is having to deal with Printers.  As we have experienced in the past, Printers have their own agenda, and tend to feel they are in creative control, which tends to diminish the integrity of certain brands, but we will not allow this to happen.  We have already scouted and researched numerous local printers, who can manage the capacity of our future orders, timelines, and specificity of our requests.  If any setbacks arise, we have backup printers ready to help with our project. Another area of potential concern would be getting our products placed in Major Retail Stores, such as Zumies, Macy's, Nordstroms, on Karmaloop.com and more.  We have spoken to these companies and they will typically carry a brand if there is a big enough demand for it.  In our local area, the demand is high, and through awareness, we hope that you (our supporters) will create a demand for our Brand, because of what we represent.  Kindness, Community Support, Self-Cultivation, Mutual Respect, Honor, and Mindfulness are the principles we wish to convey with our Movement.Fortunately, we have our website www.TempleQinesis.com that will soon be equipped with an online store, so that we can directly retail and wholesale our products out to you!We are all on this planet together, doing our best to find Peace, Harmony and Balance, and the only way we can do it, is to do this Together!!  We appreciate your support immensely, and we humbly request that if you wish to support these Virtues being embodied by our entire society, we hope you will use all your energy and passion to help spread the word on the Temple Qinesis Movement!!! Thank You ALL :)"
Bring the Seattle Geekly podcast back!|successful|Our Seattle Geekly podcast was originally from Feb 2009 to June 2011 and we had 98 episodes.  We interviewed such geeky people as Felicia Day, Len Wein (Wolverine creator), actor Doug Jones (Abe Sapien from Hellboy 1&2), authors Brenda Cooper, Seanan McGuire and we interviewed many geek bands like Kirby Krackle, Death Star & MC Frontalot. We also covered cons like PAX, Emerald City Comic Con, Norwescon & Crypticon.Our podcast ended in mid 2011, and we've been thinking of starting it up again.  It'll be mostly the same but the episodes will be shorter (45 mins to 1.5 hours) and we won't be able to cover as many local conventions as much as before.  If you'd like us back and we make the Kickstarter goal we'll commit to 1 year of podcasting or 48 episodes (not 52 due to holidays and such).  We'll have the same format, sharing our Geek Week, reviews of books, films, music, etc., interviews with authors, actors, directors, con people, etc., and other geeky issues or news.  Shannon will watch horrible geeky genre BAD movies and find at least three things good about them like she did before.  Sometimes Shannon might do the interviews by herself, but don't PANIC, Matt will co-host the podcast. We'll also keep our Twitter account @seattlegeekly updated with links to news and other geeky things & revive our Facebook page to keep in touch with our fans.  The podcasts will be available through iTunes as well as our website.  Looks like our website name was bought from under us so we've started again on either www.TheSeattleGeekly.com or www.SeattleGeekly.net. We had to end the old podcast due to $$ restraints, but that's where YOU nice people come in!  We need help to pay for our Post Office Box, our marketing material & we'll be designing a new logo, any extra money will be going to get you content.  All that and the cost of the Kickstarter rewards will go to making you have a geek year of fun!If this does go through, we'll be able to re-start the podcast by late November 2013.  We'll have to get in touch with some of the publishers that we had send us books in the past, like DC Comics, TOR Books, Quirk Books & more. With that restarted we'll have time to read a book or two for our first few episodes. Some of the rewards say the estimated shipping will be in February 2014, and that's just so we can schedule all our Guest Hosts & play dates that we have as rewards.Unfortunately we took down our website in 2011, so not many of the episodes are on the web. I've found some by torrents, so if you haven't heard our show, you can Google us. Just beware of Torrent sites. Feel free to email us and we'll select an old episode to send you.Thanks for reading through all that!  If you'd like to support us, please pledge.  Our name is Seattle Geekly but we've interviewed people from all over the world, so even if you aren't local you'll still be entertained.Thanks so much!--Shannon & MattOur risks and challenges are that it might take over a year to produce 48 episodes due to family & such, but we WILL get the promised 48 episodes up!  As for the rewards, there might be a slight production delay (due to our logo getting done), but I factored that in on the shipping estimate.If you can think of anything you'd like to know more about, please email us at seattlegeekly@gmail.com
Galactic Princess|successful|SPACE SURVIVALAs the captain of your own smuggler spaceship, lead your crew to a life of glory! How you do that is up to you! There are multiple ways to achieve this aim. From trading merchandises, even illegal ones such as space drugs or slaves if you choose so, to using diplomatic solutions.But never forget though, that the best option remains piracy, but with piracy often  the price is blood. So guard your treasures and beware of your envious opponents, especially of the corrupted members of the Spacecop alliance. To survive in space you will need to earn the best equipment:  powerful engines mighty generators deadly weapons medic systems research labs control systems                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Main Story Galactic Princess is a combination of retro-futurism and pop culture. The game plays with common clichés and well-known references, twisting them in an unexpected way. Using satire, and parody, Galactic Princess toys with Humor and Drama throughout the game.A new government saw the light, self-proclaimed under the name of “Unified Galaxy”, with no other ambition than to impose their power on the entire  galaxy. This illegitimate organization, ruled by an alliance of the most ruthless and corrupted men took and kept the power by force, establishing legions of Spacecops to maintain the control of resources.Those who did not bow to their tyranny became rebel factions, or simply independent crews, led by their trustworthy Captains. This is where you come into play. As a renowned pirate, proud smuggler and captain of your own vessel, your main desire is to remain free from the government abuses. To make your wish come true, you will have to build the strongest ship and recruit the best crew. But fate has reserved other, much greater plans for you…In your search for glory and power, a myth caught your attention; according to which somewhere in the galaxy lays a power that would bring the planets back to life. It is your destiny to travel through space looking for information that will lead you to this Power. The Myth has a name, and is known as “The legend of the Galactic Princess”                                                                                                                                  Ship Design  External Build every aspect of your spaceship, define its shape and functions. Plan your strategy according to your external module placements (weapons, shields, engines, sensors…). For example, you can builda Battle Cruiser: a heavy fighter with many powerful weapons, coupled with strong shields but lacking in maneuverability and speed. Or you can create a blitz fighter, very maneuverable, allowing you to weave in and out of asteroid belts while whittling away at your enemy.Define the strategy that suits you best.         Your ship’s physics will react to those choices!  Function Samples●	Weapons: There are numerous types of weapons to equip your ship with:Offensive: plasma lasers, laser beams, rockets, multi-directional explosives, 				      anti-matter charges, fusion sticky bombs, mines…Defensive: decoys, baits, cloaking devices, electromagnetic-charges, time-bender... 		●	Engines: Engines affect your movements and speed and allow you to perform tricky maneuvers, crucial against an overpowered enemy or an asteroid field! With special engines, you can reach the speed of light. ●	Shields: Shields will cover specific areas of your ship; choose wisely which area to protect to ensure the safety of your ship’s vital functions and crew.  ●	Sensors: Sensors will provide you information about the enemy and other important aspects such as distance, level, type etc. They can be used to make navigation easier and also help you strategize for difficult battles.  ShipDesignInternal  ●Monitors: Payclose attention to your monitors. Most of the information you willneed is not represented through the classic interface but through a Diegeticinterface. This means that all your required  info will be displayed on different monitors and screens of your spaceship.●Engineering room: This room allows the engines and shields to function properly, and thus protects your ship. Adding more engineering rooms will boost their efficiency.●Artificial intelligence room:This room controls the support functions of the ship, and provides feedbacks such as: O² level, fire alert, enemy alert, door status…●Medic systems: Used to heal your crew from space related ailments. Further on, you will even be able to upgrade them with some cyber-implants while recovering.●Prison:  Captured a political prisoner?  Keep themhere and trade them for some much needed supplies or even information.●Cargo hold:The place to keep your contraband goods. Cargo can also be used to store scout ships.●Cockpit:Also known as the control room. It is the heart of the spaceship, so always keep it safe!●Research labs:Those little guns you start with aren'tgoing to cut it for long. Come here toupgrade and research new weapons. ●Docking ports: Allowyou to dock and board the enemies’ ships. Spaceship vs. SpaceshipThe combat phases will take two forms: Spaceship VS.Spaceship, and Crew VS. Crew, but keep in mind that whatever happens to yourship will also  affect your crew inside.You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.PlayReplay with soundPlay with  sound00:0000:00●Defineyour strategy according to your enemy’s strengths and weaknesses.●Useyour weapons to destroy the enemy’s vital functions and open a breach.●Destroytheir weapons or jam their sensors…●Destroytheir engines to incapacitate their movements. ●Maneuverto avoid taking damages, or to choose the impact area.●Createhull breaches to slowly drain their oxygen levels.●Boardthe enemy ship and launch your looting operation. It’s time to scavenge somegoods. Crew vs. CrewIn the wild space, everyone does their best to survive: some use diplomacy, others prefer less shady methods such as theft, but most of them will find a far greater interest in fighting. Their purpose?Steal equipment and enslave crew.To bring your battle to a successful conclusion, youwill need a clear understanding of your opponents’ capabilities, and of courseknow the strengths and weaknesses of your crew like no other. Each member of your crew can be assigned to a specific task or position. Like in a classic RTS game.The battle crew's role is to protect the ship frominvasions, as well as invade the enemies’ ship in return.You must take their races into consideration: equipyour melee fighters with close range weapons and your gunners with long rangeweapons.Real time tactical pause : To facilitate your management and tactical decisions, an active pause will help you to assign your orders.TacticalBattles and training increase the level of experience of your crew.The captain is the most valuable element of your crew, protect him at any cost. There is no hope for a crew without a true leader, strength and honor is the path chosen by the greatest captains of the galaxy.Assign your crew members to different rooms of your ship: each crew member working on a system increases the power of its functions.Manage your units with efficiency and relevance: ●	Place a core blaster team to control the important hubs.●	Lead your close combat unit to their target avoiding the blaster fight areas●	Protect the important rooms, cargo, prisoners and captain.●	Use your race’s special abilities to overcome the enemy’s weaknesses.●	Use the environment to keep your crew out of the line of fire.●	Find the captain. Then kill him or force his surrender to win the battle.Equipment is an important part of the smugglers' treasure hoard, and nothing is more reliable than the blasters on your ship… During your journey you will discover countless weapons, through trading, looting, or simply as a reward. Be strategic; equip your crew members in accordance with  their race or specialization to improve their capabilities and chances of survival.  BIO-DIVERSITYThe galaxy is  vast  and surprisingly full of life! During your journey, you will encounter many species...Will they become trusted allies to trade with?Will they be deadly rivals to battle or enslave?Will they join your crew as friends, or as slaves? SoundtrackIn space, the sound of nothingness can drive you crazy… and music will be more than an appreciated friend, whether during your lonely travels or enduring the vivid battles. Thus, our intentions are to provide various soundscapes throughout the adventure. Faithfull to its “retro-futurism” direction, the game will therefore allow you  to enjoy classical music compositions as well as modern rhythms, and even experimental ones. While the music of the trailer is signed by Dynatron, our goal for the entire game is to offer an eclectic OST, influenced by a diversity of artists with strong identities, strengthening thereby the dramatic intensity. Reward Samples                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  As in many video games, there is no challenge without risk, nor risk without challenge.Our goal with Galactic Princess is to offer the deepest experience possible: give the players a great creative freedom and allow them to experiment and discover new ways to play.The relative challenge will be to offer a coherent feeling between experimentation of the sandbox aspect of the game and the narrative situations that player will encounter.We are confident about the attractiveness of the gameplay mechanics, but in order to make the game even more interesting, we will need to produce a lot of content: more weapons, more characters, more unexpected situations, more music, more, more, always more! And depending on how much we decide to implement in the game, it may result in a potential delay of the release date. This will be for the best!
La Feria Concreta: A Documentary Film Installation|successful|This year the Dominican Republic will be represented at the 14th International Architecture Exhibition La Biennale di Venezia!  As part of the exhibit, with your help, we are creating a short documentary film  that will be an integral part of the installation.  La Bolita, Santo DomingoOur organization, Laboratorio de Arquitectura (LAD) has been invited to curate the first Dominican pavilion. The focus of our exhibit is the grounds of La Feria, a complex of buildings and monuments in the city of Santo Domingo built in the 1950s by the brutal dictator Rafael Leonidas Trujillo. La Feria was Trujillo’s stage to demonstrate his power and wealth to the world. Today it is a very different place.The 8 minute documentary film installation will focus on the daily life of La Feria and how people experience it, night and day. Teatro Agua Y Luz, Santo DomingoLa Feria is constantly evolving, During the day it is frequented by working government officials, shoe shiners, coconut sellers, dogs, and chickens. At night it turns into a center of informal activities. What was once a powerful landmark is today a center of dualities and juxtapositions. The architecture that remains is hauntingly beautiful. We are interested in creating a visual exploration of a dualistic place and  how it changes character, as an architectural protagonist, from night into day and back again. Seeing a place as a character makes it more than merely a setting for what occurs within it, it actually shapes it, influences it, perhaps even determines it.La Bolita, photo by Christy Cheng during scout-tripThe film will be directed by award-winning filmmaker Corinne van der Borch. Her last feature, Girl with Black Balloons was successfully funded on Kickstarter, was nominated for audience award at the Edinburgh International Film festival, and won the Grand Jury prize at DOC NYC 2011. Filming will happen over the course of 1 week in Santo Domingo this April and editing will occur throughout May. The film will exhibit at the Dominican Pavillion in the Venice Architecture Biennale from June 7, 2014 to November 23, 2014. Bringing this untold Dominican story to the Biennale is a once in a lifetime opportunity, and you can be a part of it. This is an important moment for the Dominican Republic, and we need you're help to make it happen! La Feria at NightOur goal is $10,000. The way it works;  its all-or-nothing, we can always raise more than our set goal but never less.HOW DOES KICKSTARTER WORK?Make a Donation to the film, and you get a reward from the list to the right.Choose the amount you’d like to donate, and the gift you’d like to receive.

We are also fortunate to be well connected to other pavilions at the Venice Biennale that have graciously offered to help with some of our needs if we wind up short staffed at the actual event. In the end we believe the film, and the larger project, are about people working together to create something innovative and compelling. Judging from the dedication and adaptability of our team thus far, we hope that no challenge will be too great!
Debut Original Album by Mindy Stratton|successful|"I need your help! I've been on this line, this precipice of jumping into an unknown realm of recording and producing an album. In the past, I would get right up to the edge and then back off. But this time I'm going forward! God began this work and I am depending on and believing in His timing. So, I'm ready to jump! I'm tired of letting fear keep me from doing what I know I God is prompting me to do. I will lean not on my own understanding and trust that He will make my paths straight. Thank you, in advance, for your prayers, support and encouragement!The plan going forward:After funding is acquired, the fun begins! This is an incredible endeavor. I have a studio lined up that will handle recording, mastering and producing the album. This will take some time! It will take many of hours of recording, tweaking, retweaking and mastering. I will give regular updates so you can know how recording is going and how you can pray for us.While we are recording (actually, even as we write this) we will be working on album title, art and marketing. This will be a fun but exhausting time of poring over ideas, designs, information, etc. and compiling everything into a concise, clean plan. After mastering is complete we will submit the album for production and distribution.We will lose 7-10% of the funding right off the top due to costs of running credit cards, the use of the kickstarter funding platform, etc. (We have done our best to figure this into the funding request amount).When production is finished, the fun stuff really amps up! We will then mail out/give links to the new album, plus any extra special gifts to those who qualify and have helped fund the project. We are thankful to everyone, every gift, every bit of encouragement and every prayer!**VERY IMPORTANT: Kickstarter is an ""all or nothing"" fundraising forum -- so if you decide to make a pledge but February 14th arrives and we are still short of $5K, the project will sadly fall through. For this reason, your card will not be charged until the deadline is over, and ONLY if we reach our goal... so any way you can help promote this page and spread the word would be greatly appreciated!****Also, we are always able to raise more funds than our goal (just not less). Raising more funds will allow us to record more songs for future albums.**Thank you and God bless you!!!"
Night_Rider|failed|We are a small studio who is passionate about film in various genres.  We have a clear vision for this project and nearly all the materials required to get it on screen.  Most of our film has been funded out of our own pockets. But there are still some outstanding items that are needed to bring this project to life, such as equipment rental and purchase, costs to cover filming permits, and location fees.  All we need to finish things up is YOUR help! We just wrapped up our shooting script and shot list and our storyboard is also nearly complete.  We have an excellent cast, script and soundtrack!  We start Principal Photography on July 11th 2014. We will be finished no later than July 14th. The finished and edited project is projected to be complete no later than August 1.
